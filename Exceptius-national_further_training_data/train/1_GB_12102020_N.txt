(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations impose restrictions on gatherings and businesses in the areas specified in Schedule 2, where the COVID-19 alert level is assessed as being very high, and on gatherings elsewhere by persons living in the specified areas.

The restrictions will cease to have effect in relation to a particular area 28 days from the date in which the restrictions came into force in that area, unless the Secretary of State directs otherwise. If such a direction is issued, the restrictions will continue in effect for a further 28 days.

The need for the restrictions in these Regulations must be reviewed by the Secretary of State every 28 days. The Regulations themselves expire six months after the date on which they are made.
