EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations make provision with respect to certain traffic orders made and notices given in Wales, under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. They are being introduced as an emergency measure in response to the effects of coronavirus.

They amend the procedure for making traffic orders and giving notices by providing an alternative means of publicising orders in circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable to follow the current publicity requirements as a result of coronavirus. They also simplify the procedure for making temporary traffic orders that are made for purposes connected to coronavirus.

These Regulations amend—

(a)the Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Procedure Regulations 1992 (“the 1992 Regulations”);
(b)the Local Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England and Wales) Regulations 1996 (“the 1996 Regulations”); and
(c)the Secretary of State’s Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England and Wales) Regulations 1990 (“the 1990 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the 1992 Regulations, which set out procedures in connection with the making of temporary traffic orders and the giving of notices by inserting a new Part 7 into those Regulations (inserting new regulations 22 to 27). The new regulation 23 relates to the publicity requirements for traffic regulation orders and notices. The amendments provide a traffic authority with the option of using alternative arrangements for publicising a notice relating to a traffic order, where it is not reasonably practicable to publish in a newspaper circulating in the area, or to post notices on site, for reasons connected to the effects of coronavirus, including restrictions on movement.

The new regulation 24 relates to temporary traffic orders which are made for purposes connected to coronavirus. A simplified procedure applies to the making of orders that fall within this purpose.

Regulation 3 amends the 1996 Regulations, which set out procedures for making permanent and experimental traffic orders, by inserting a new Part 7 into those Regulations (inserting new regulations 30 to 33). The amendments provide an order making authority with the option of using alternative arrangements for publicising a notice relating to a traffic order, where it is not reasonably practicable to publish in a newspaper circulating in the area for reasons connected to the effects of coronavirus, including restrictions on movement. They also permit a traffic authority to use alternative means to make documents available to the public, where it is not reasonably practicable to make documents available for inspection at a specific address, for reasons connected to the effects of coronavirus.

Regulation 4 amends the 1990 Regulations, which set out procedures for certain traffic orders made by the Welsh Ministers in relation to trunk roads and countryside roads, and orders under the Welsh Ministers’ reserve powers in Schedule 9 to the 1984 Act. These amendments are to the same effect as the amendments made to the 1996 Regulations.

The amendments made by these Regulations will cease to have effect at the end of 31 July 2021. These Regulations provide for transitional provisions to preserve continuity following the expiry of the amendments.

The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. A regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as the Regulations need to be put in place quickly to deal with an emergency associated with the effects of coronavirus.

(1)1984 c. 27. Section 16(2) and (2A) was substituted by the Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Act 1991 (c. 26), section 1(2); sections 35C and 46A were inserted by the Road Traffic Act 1991 (c. 40), sections 41 and 42; section 134(10) was inserted by the Wales Act 2017 (c. 4), section 69(1), Schedule 6, Part 3, paragraphs 43(1) and (3). In Schedule 9, paragraph 21 was amended by the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (c. 22), Schedule 8, paragraph 80 and Schedule 9; and paragraph 25 was amended by the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, Schedule 8, paragraph 80. By virtue of S.I. 1999/672, and section 162 of, and paragraph 30 of Schedule 11 to, the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32), these powers are now exercisable by the Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales. The references to “national authority” in section 16(2) and (2A), and in Part III of Schedule 9 were inserted by the Scotland Act 2016, (c. 11) and the definition of “national authority” in section 142(1) was amended by the Wales Act 2017, Part 2, section 26(8) so that “national authority” in relation to Wales, means the Welsh Ministers.
(2)S.I. 1992/1215, amended by S.I. 2006/1177. There are other amendments which are not relevant.
(3)S.I. 1996/2489. There are amendments which are not relevant.
