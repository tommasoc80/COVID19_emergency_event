EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)

These Rules amend the Patents (Fees) Rules 2007 (SI 2007/3292), the Trade Marks (Fees) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/1958) and the Registered Designs (Fees) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/889) (“the Fees Rules”). The Fees Rules prescribe the fees payable in respect of matters arising under the Patents Act 1977 (c. 37), the Trade Marks Act 1994 (c.26) and the Registered Designs Act 1949 (c.88).

These Rules reduce certain of the fees prescribed in the Fees Rules to nil (or, in one case, to £1) in respect of the period beginning on 30th July 2020 and ending on 31st March 2021. The relevant fees consist of: (i) fees applicable to extensions of time periods for the filing of documents, (ii) surcharges for the late payment of certain other fees, in particular the late payment of fees to maintain in force a patent, trade mark or registered design, and (iii) fees to reinstate patent applications or restore patents, trade marks and registered designs which have been removed from the register. The reduction of such fees to nil (or, in one case, to £1) addresses the potential effects of coronavirus on the ability of applicants for and proprietors of patents, trade marks and registered designs to comply with certain requirements within the prescribed time limits.

An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as this is a temporary, emergency measure and no significant impact on business, charities, voluntary bodies and the public sector is foreseen.
