EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996 (“the 1996 Regulations”) in order to further extend the validity of driving theory test pass certificates given the current suspension of practical testing due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) public health emergency.

Accordingly, regulation 2 of these Regulations amends regulations 36 and 36B of the 1996 Regulations so that the validity of a theory test pass certificate that expires between 1st March 2020 and 31st October 2020, is extended for a period of twelve months from the date of expiry shown on the certificate; the extension that had been initially applied was for an eight month period. In addition, regulations 36 and 36B of the 1996 Regulations are now amended so that the validity of a theory test pass certificate that expires between 1st November 2020 and 30th June 2021, is extended for a period of eight months from the date of expiry shown on the certificate.
