(2) A person who presents at immigration control at the Channel Tunnel shuttle terminal area in France F18, with the intention of boarding a shuttle service destined for the United Kingdom, must provide on the Passenger Locator Form their passenger information on so presenting.

(3) Subject to paragraph (4), a person who arrives in England from within the common travel area who has been outside the common travel area at any time in the period beginning with the [F1910th] day before the date of their arrival in England must provide on the Passenger Locator Form their passenger information on their arrival.

(4) Paragraph (3) does not apply to a person described in that paragraph who arrives in England from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and who has completed a form equivalent to a Passenger Locator Form pursuant to an enactment in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, [F20specifying—

(a)in the case of a person who is required to comply with regulation 4, an address in England where that person intends to self-isolate, or
(b)in the case of any other person, an address in England where that person intends to stay during the period of [F2110] days beginning on the day after the date of their arrival in the United Kingdom].
(5) A person who is travelling with a child for whom they have responsibility, must ensure that passenger information is provided in relation to that child on the Passenger Locator Form—

(a)on their arrival in England, in the case of a person described in paragraph (1) or (3), or
(b)when they present at immigration control, in the case of a person described in paragraph (2).
(6) If a person described in any of paragraphs (1) to (3) provides their passenger information, and any passenger information required by virtue of paragraph (5), on the Passenger Locator Form in the 48 hours before they are required to do so, then they are treated as having complied with those paragraphs (as applicable).

(7) A person who has provided passenger information in advance in accordance with paragraph (6) must provide evidence that they have done so if requested by an immigration officer.

(8) If passenger information changes or becomes available to a person required to self-isolate during that person's period of self-isolation in England that person must, as soon as reasonably possible take all reasonable steps to complete a Passenger Locator Form, or a new Passenger Locator Form, as the case may be.

(9) Nothing in this regulation requires a person to provide any information if that information is not within their possession or control.

[F22(10) The following are not required to comply with this regulation—

(a)a person described in regulation 4(12),
(b)a person described in any of paragraphs 1 to 4 of Schedule 2,
(c)a person described in any of paragraphs 4A to 4F of Schedule 2 who meets the condition in paragraph 4G of that Schedule,

Article 4(1) of the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993 (S.I. 1993/1813) has the effect of extending all frontier control enactments to the control zone in France. A “frontier control enactment” is an enactment which contains provision relating to frontier controls and the definition of “frontier controls” in Schedule 1 to that Order includes controls in relation to health. The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and these Regulations made under it therefore apply in the control zone.

F377
Sch. 2D inserted (6.4.2021 at 4.00 a.m.) by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) (Amendment) (No. 11) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/442), regs. 1(2), 11 (with reg. 13)

Interpretation of Schedule 2D
1.  In this Schedule—

“P” means a person required to undertake workforce tests under regulation 3C (requirement to undertake workforce tests);“the Self-Isolation Regulations” means the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020;“workforce test” means any of the categories of workforce test described in regulation 3C(6).
Requirement after failure to undertake test
2.—(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where P fails to undertake a workforce test that P is required by regulation 3C to undertake.

(2) Where this sub-paragraph applies, P must self-isolate in accordance with regulation 2 of the Self-Isolation Regulations until the earlier of—

(a)the end of the 14th day after the day on which they arrived in England; or
(b)the time P obtains a negative result from a workforce test.
(3) P must comply with any applicable obligations in regulation 3C(2) during any period that P is required to self-isolate in accordance with paragraph (2).

(4) Where P is required to self-isolate in accordance with paragraph (2), regulation 2(2) of the Self-Isolation Regulations (meaning of self-isolate) applies as if it also permitted P to leave the place of self-isolation where necessary to undertake a workplace test.

Consequences of test results
3.—(1) Where a workforce test undertaken by P in accordance with regulation 3C generates a positive result—

(a)P must as soon as reasonably practicable undertake a further test which complies with the requirements for a day 2 test specified in paragraph 6 of Schedule 2C, in the circumstances specified in paragraph 10 of that Schedule (other than the circumstances in paragraph 10(2) about when a test must be undertaken);
(b)P must self-isolate in accordance with regulation 2 of the Self-Isolation Regulations until the end of the 10th day after the day P undertook the test.
(2) Where a workforce test undertaken by P in accordance with regulation 3C generates a positive result—

(a)if that test was a workforce test undertaken for day 2, P is not required to undertake a workforce test for day 5 or day 8;
(b)if that test was a workforce test undertaken for day 5, P is not required to undertake a workforce test for day 8;
(3) Where a further test undertaken in accordance with paragraph (1)(a) generates a negative result, this paragraph applies to P from the time P is notified of that negative result as if the workforce test undertaken by P in accordance with regulation 3C had generated a negative result (and accordingly, from that time, P is no longer required to self-isolate).

(4) Paragraph 11(4) and (5) (notification of test results) of Schedule 2C (mandatory testing after arrival in England) applies in relation to a further test undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1)(a) as it applies to a test provider in relation to a test provided under Schedule 2C.

(5) Where a workforce test undertaken by P in accordance with regulation 3C generates an inconclusive result, P must as soon as reasonably practicable undertake a further workforce test and that further workforce test is to be treated as a replacement workforce test within the meaning of regulation 3C(4) (requirement to undertake workforce tests).

Duties on employers
4.—(1) An employer with more than 50 employees who is the employer of any person who is required to undertake workforce tests or has responsibility for any agency worker who is required to undertake workforce tests, must take reasonable steps to facilitate the taking of those tests by that person or agency worker in accordance with these Regulations.

(2) In the discharge of the duty under sub-paragraph (1), an employer must have regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this paragraph.

(3) In paragraph (1) an employer has responsibility for an agency worker if—

(a)the agency worker is supplied or to be supplied by a person (an “agent”) to the employer under a contract or other arrangements made between the agent and the employer; and
(b)the agency worker is not—
(i)a worker because of the absence of a worker’s contract between the agency worker and the agent or the employer, or
(ii)a party to a contract under which the agency worker undertakes to do the work for another party to a contract whose status is, by virtue of the contract, that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the agency worker.]

(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations impose requirements on people arriving in England from outside the common travel area (that is, the open borders area comprising the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands), in order to prevent the spread of infection or contamination from coronavirus or coronavirus disease.

The Regulations require those people (i) to provide information including contact details and details of their intended onward travel, and (ii) to self-isolate for a period of 14 days following their arrival in the common travel area. Certain categories of person, including flight crew etc. are exempt from the requirements.
