EXPLANATORY NOTE

These Regulations make temporary modifications to the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013, Town and Country Planning (Schemes of Delegation and Local Review Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013 and the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017. These modifications alter requirements to hold public events or hearings or to make information or documentation available for inspection in a public place.

Regulation 2 amends the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013 to remove the requirement for a public event to be held as part of pre-application consultation procedures during the “emergency period”. The emergency period is defined by reference to section 12 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act. Regulation 3 amends the Town and Country Planning (Schemes of Delegation and Local Review Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013 to remove the requirement for meetings of the local review body to be held in public during the emergency period. Regulation 4 amends the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 so that during the emergency period a developer is not required to ensure that copies of an EIA report are available for inspection at a physical location.
