EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations require the closure of businesses listed in Schedule 2, to protect against the risks to public health arising from coronavirus, except for limited permitted uses. They also impose restrictions on gatherings both inside and outside, of more than 30 people. The closures and restrictions last until they are terminated by a direction given by the Secretary of State. They also give the Secretary of State power to restrict public access to any public outdoor space.

The need for the restrictions in these Regulations must be reviewed by the Secretary of State every 28 days, with the first review taking place by 28th July 2020. The need for any restrictions made in a direction given by the Secretary of State restricting public access to land must be reviewed every 7 days, starting with the seventh day after the direction is issued.

No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.
