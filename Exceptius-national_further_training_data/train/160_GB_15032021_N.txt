EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend regulation 52 of the Taking Control of Goods Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/1894) to specify the minimum amount of outstanding rent for the purposes of section 77(3) of the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (c.15) (the “2007 Act”), which will apply to commercial rent arrears recovery during the relevant period as defined in section 82 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (c.7).

Regulation 2(3) provides that, the minimum amount of net unpaid rent before an enforcement action can take place under section 77(3)(a) of the 2007 Act (for a notice of enforcement) and under section 77(3)(b) of the 2007 Act (for the first time goods are taken control of), is 276 days’ rent where it takes place on or before 24th December 2020 and 366 days’ rent respectively where it takes place on or after 25th December 2020.

The definition of the 2020 Regulations is omitted as it is no longer needed now that date is historic. The amendments do not affect any enforcement action taken prior to these Regulations coming into force.

As these are temporary, emergency regulations, no impact assessment has been prepared.
