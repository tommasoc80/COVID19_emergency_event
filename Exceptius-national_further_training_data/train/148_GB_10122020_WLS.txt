This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Wales) Order 2012 (“the 2012 Order”) and the Developments of National Significance (Procedure) (Wales) Order 2016 (“the 2016 Order”).

Article 2 amends article 2G(2)(b) of the 2012 Order to extend the emergency period during which the publicity and notice requirements for pre-application consultation are modified. It also extends the emergency period for the purpose of the time which community councils have to make representations on applications notified to them. The emergency period ends on 8 October 2021.

Article 3 amends article 12(6A)(b) of the 2016 Order to extend the period during which hard copies of applications for developments of national significance are not required. That period ends on 8 October 2021.
