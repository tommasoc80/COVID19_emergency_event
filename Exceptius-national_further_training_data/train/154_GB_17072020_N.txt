EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)

These Rules amend the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3132) to insert a new, temporary, rule which provides for how possession proceedings and enforcement proceedings by way of writ and warrant for possession, which were stayed until 23rd August 2020 by S.I. 2020/582, are to proceed after that stay expires.

The new rule provides (in exercise of the power given in paragraph 6 of the Schedule 1 to the Civil Procedure Act 1997 (c. 12)) that proceedings are to proceed as provided for by a new, temporary practice direction, Practice Direction 55C, which is added to the practice directions supporting the Civil Procedure Rules. That practice direction is published on the Ministry of Justice website at http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil.

As this is temporary, emergency legislation, no formal impact assessment is required for Better Regulation purposes.
