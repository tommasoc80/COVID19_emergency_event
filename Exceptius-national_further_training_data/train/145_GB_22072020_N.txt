The special rules
900ESpecial rule: section 900B case
(1)This section applies in respect of a restricted asset of a company if it is a restricted asset by reason of section 900B.
(2)If the company was the first company to acquire the asset on or after 1 July 2020, the relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the company acquired the asset at no cost.
(3)If the company was not the first company to acquire the asset on or after 1 July 2020, the relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the company acquired the asset for the adjusted amount.
(4)The adjusted amount is—

where—

A is the amount of consideration—
(a)for which the company actually acquired the asset, or
(b)if different, for which it would (ignoring this section) be treated for the purposes of the Taxes Acts as having acquired the asset, and
B is the market value of the asset on the date it was first acquired by a company on or after 1 July 2020.
(5)Where B is greater than A the adjusted amount is nil.
(6)In this section—
“market value”, in relation to an asset, means the price the asset might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market, and
“the relevant Chapters of this Part” means—
(a)Chapter 3 (debits in respect of intangible fixed assets),
(b)Chapter 15 (adjustments on change of accounting policy), and
(c)Chapter 5 (calculation of tax written-down value) in so far as it has effect for the purposes of Chapters 3 and 15.
900FSpecial rule: section 900C or 900D case
(1)This section applies in respect of a restricted asset of a company if it is a restricted asset by reason of section 900C or 900D.
(2)The relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the company acquired the asset for the adjusted amount.
(3)The adjusted amount is calculated as follows—
Step 1 Find the amount—
(a)for which the company actually acquired the asset, or
(b)if different, for which it would (ignoring this section) be treated for the purposes of the Taxes Acts as having acquired the asset.
Step 2 Deduct from the amount found at Step 1 such proportion of the notional deduction amount for the relevant other asset or each relevant other asset as is just and reasonable in the circumstances.
(4)Where the deduction at Step 2 results in a negative value the adjusted amount is nil.
(5)In subsection (3)—
“relevant other asset” means an asset by reference to which the conditions in paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 900C(2) or (as the case may be) the conditions in section 900D(2) were met, and
“the notional deduction amount”, in relation to a relevant other asset, means—
(a)in a case where section 900E(2) would have applied had the company acquired the relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset, an amount equal to the market value of the relevant other asset at the time the restricted asset was acquired, and
(b)in a case where section 900E(3) would have applied had the company acquired the relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset, an amount equal to the market value of the relevant other asset at the time it was first acquired by a company on or after 1 July 2020, and
(c)in a case where subsection (2) of this section would have applied had the company acquired the relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset, the amount that would have been deducted at step 2 of subsection (3) of this section if the company had acquired the relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset.
(6)In this section “market value” and “the relevant Chapters of this Part” have the same meaning as in section 900E.
Supplementary provisions

(b)a single asset comprising restricted assets is treated as itself being a restricted asset, and
(c)a single asset comprising standard intangible fixed assets is treated as itself being a standard intangible fixed asset.
900LRealisation of fungible assets: pre-FA 2002 assets and restricted assets
(1)This section applies if—
(a)a company realises a fungible asset, and
(b)apart from subsection (1) of section 900K, the asset would be treated as part of a single asset comprising more than one of the kinds of asset referred to in that subsection.
(2)The realisation is treated—
(a)as diminishing a single asset of the company comprising pre-FA 2002 assets in priority to diminishing a single asset of the company comprising restricted assets or a single asset of the company comprising standard intangible fixed assets, and
(b)as diminishing a single asset of the company comprising restricted assets in priority to diminishing a single asset of the company comprising standard intangible fixed assets.
900MAcquisition of fungible assets: pre-FA 2002 assets and restricted assets
(1)Fungible assets acquired by a company that would not otherwise be treated as pre-FA 2002 assets are so treated so far as they are identified, in accordance with the following rules, with pre-FA 2002 assets realised by the company.

(5)Rule 2 is that assets realised earlier are identified before assets realised later.
(6)Rule 3 is that assets acquired earlier are identified before assets acquired later.
900NDebits in respect of a single asset comprising restricted assets
(1)This section applies in respect of a single asset of a company that comprises restricted assets (and is itself treated as a restricted asset by reason of section 900K(2)(b)).
(2)The relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the company acquired the single asset for the sum of the amounts for which the company would have been treated for the purposes of those Chapters as having acquired each of the restricted assets that comprises the single asset.
(3)In this section “the relevant Chapter of this Part” has the meaning given by section 900E(6).
900OInterpretation
In this Chapter—
“restricted asset” has the same meaning as in Chapter 16A, and

(CT2 will be zero if the company would not be liable to pay any corporation tax for the period).
(2)The amount of qualifying corporation tax which the company is liable to pay is the difference between CT1 and CT2.

(b)it is a disposal to a company (“the transferee”) that at the time of the disposal is resident outside the United Kingdom in an EEA state, and
(c)it is a disposal to which section 139 or 171 of TCGA 1992 would apply were the transferee resident at the time of the disposal in the United Kingdom instead.
(3)A transaction is within this sub-paragraph if—
(a)it is a transaction, or the first in a series of transactions, as a result of which the company concerned is directly or indirectly replaced as a party to a loan relationship by another company (“the transferee”),
(b)at the time of the transaction the transferee is resident outside the United Kingdom in an EEA state, and
(c)it is a transaction to which section 340(3) of CTA 2009 would apply were the transferee resident at the time of the transaction in the United Kingdom instead.

(a)it is a transaction, or the first in a series of transactions, as a result of which the company concerned is directly or indirectly replaced as a party to a derivative contract by another company (“the transferee”),
(b)at the time of the transaction the transferee is resident outside the United Kingdom in an EEA state, and
(c)it is a transaction to which section 625(3) of CTA 2009 would apply were the transferee resident at the time of the transaction in the United Kingdom instead.
(5)A transfer is within this sub-paragraph if—
(a)it is a transfer from the company concerned of an intangible fixed asset,
(b)it is a transfer to a company (“the transferee”) that immediately after the transfer is resident outside the United Kingdom in an EEA state, and
(c)it is a transfer to which section 775(1) of CTA 2009 would apply were the transferee resident immediately after the transfer in the United Kingdom instead.

Application to enter a CT payment plan
5A company that is liable to pay qualifying corporation tax for an accounting period may enter into a CT payment plan in respect of the tax only if—

(a)an application to enter into the plan is made to HMRC before the end of the period of 9 months beginning immediately after the accounting period, and
(b)the application contains details of all the matters which are required by paragraph 7 to be specified in the plan.

(2)The CT payment plan may, in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (3), contain appropriate provision regarding security for HMRC in respect of the payment of the deferred tax.

(b)the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs—
(i)may not seek payment of the deferred tax otherwise than in accordance with paragraphs 9 to 12;
(ii)may make repayments in respect of any amount of the deferred tax paid, or any amount paid on account of the deferred tax, before the CT payment plan is entered into.
(3)As regards interest—
(a)the deferred tax carries interest in accordance with Part 9 as if the CT payment plan had not been entered into, and
(b)each time a payment is made in accordance with paragraphs 9 to 12, it is to be paid together with any interest payable on it.
(4)As regards penalties, the company will be liable to penalties for late payment of the deferred tax only if it fails to make payments in accordance with paragraphs 9 to 12 (see item 6ZAA of the Table at the end of paragraph 1 of Schedule 56 to the Finance Act 2009).
(5)Any of the deferred tax which is for the time being unpaid may be paid at any time before it becomes payable under paragraphs 9 to 12 together with interest payable on it to the date of payment.

(a)the first instalment is due on the first day after the period of 9 months beginning immediately after the end of the accounting period to which the plan relates, and
(b)the other 5 instalments are due one on each of the first 5 anniversaries of that day.
(2)But see paragraphs 10 to 12 for circumstances in which all or part of the outstanding balance of the deferred tax becomes due otherwise than by those instalments.
The payment method: all of outstanding balance due
10(1)Where at any time after a CT payment plan is entered into by a company an event mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) occurs the outstanding balance of the deferred tax is due on the date on which the next instalment of that tax would otherwise be due.

(6)On the occurrence of the trigger event an amount of the deferred tax is due.
(7)The amount due is—

where—

“A” is the amount of the deferred tax that is attributable to the qualifying transaction (see paragraph 7(2)),
“B” is the amount of the deferred tax that has previously become due under paragraph 12 by reason of a partial trigger event occurring in relation to the qualifying transaction,
“O” is the amount of the deferred tax that is outstanding at the time of the trigger event, and
“T” is the amount of the deferred tax.
(8)In this paragraph “the instalments period” means the period—

(a)a CT payment plan is entered into by a company,
(b)during the instalments period a partial trigger event occurs in relation to a qualifying transaction listed in the plan, and
(c)a trigger event has not previously occurred in relation to that qualifying transaction during the instalments period.

(3)A partial trigger event occurs in relation to a qualifying transaction within sub-paragraph (3) or (4) of paragraph 3 if there is a disposal by the transferee of a right or liability under the loan relationship or derivative contract concerned which amounts to a related transaction (as defined in section 304 or 596 of CTA 2009 as the case may be).
(4)A partial trigger event occurs in relation to a qualifying transaction within sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 3 if the transferee enters into a subsequent transaction which results in a reduction in the accounting value of the intangible fixed asset that is the subject of the qualifying transaction but does not result in the intangible fixed asset ceasing to be recognised in the transferee's balance sheet.
(5)In relation to an intangible fixed asset that has no balance sheet value (or no longer has a balance sheet value) sub-paragraph (4) applies as if, immediately before the subsequent transaction, it did have a balance sheet value.
(6)On the occurrence of the partial trigger event an amount of the deferred tax is due.
(7)The amount due is the amount that is just and reasonable having regard to the amount that would have been due had a trigger event occurred in relation to the qualifying transaction instead.
(8)In this paragraph “the instalments period” and “trigger event” have the same meaning as in paragraph 11.”

Agreement to postpone payment of tax
47(1)If the appellant and HMRC agree that payment of an amount of tax should be postponed pending the determination of the appeal, the consequences are to be the same (for all purposes) as if the tribunal had, at the time when the agreement was entered into, made a direction to the same effect as the agreement.This is without prejudice to the making of a further agreement or further direction.

(b)which would not have been charged by the amendment or assessment if there had been no appeal.

Payment of tax where there is a further appeal

Penalty for failure to notify: knowledge of non-entitlement to payment
13(1)This paragraph applies to a failure of a person to notify, under section 7 of TMA 1970 (as modified by paragraph 12), a liability to income tax chargeable under paragraph 8 where the person knew, at the time the income tax first became chargeable, that the person was not entitled to the amount of the coronavirus support payment in relation to which the tax is chargeable.

(3)Where a partner would be liable to a penalty under Schedule 41 to FA 2008 (whether in a case falling within paragraph 13 or otherwise), the partner is instead jointly and severally liable with the other partners to a single penalty under that Schedule for the failures by each of them to notify.

(4)In a case not falling within paragraph 13, if the failure of at least one of the partners—

(a)was deliberate and concealed, the single penalty is to be treated as a penalty for a deliberate and concealed failure;

(b)was deliberate but not concealed, the single penalty is to be treated as a penalty for a deliberate but not concealed failure.

(5)For the purposes of Schedule 41 to FA 2008, the “potential lost revenue” is to be treated as being the amount of income tax which would have been assessable on any one of the partners (see paragraph 9(4)(a))—
