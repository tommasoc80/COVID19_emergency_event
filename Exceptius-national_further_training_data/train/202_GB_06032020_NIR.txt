EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations.)

These regulations amend the Provision of Health Services to Persons Not Ordinarily Resident Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) which make provision as to the entitlement of, and exemption from charges for, services forming part of health services which may be provided to visitors to Northern Ireland.

Regulation 4(1)(d) of the 2015 Regulations provides that no charge shall be made in respect of services forming part of the health services that are provided to a visitor for treatment in respect of a disease listed in Schedule 1 to the 2015 Regulations. Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends that Schedule to insert an entry for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). The effect is that a visitor who is being treated in a hospital in Northern Ireland for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) will be exempt from charges for any Health Service treatment received in respect of that condition.
