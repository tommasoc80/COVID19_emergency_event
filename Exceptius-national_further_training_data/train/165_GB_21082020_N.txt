EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)

These Rules amend the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998/3132) to amend rule 55.29, which provides that possession proceedings and enforcement proceedings by way of writ and warrant for possession are stayed until 23rd August 2020. This amendment extends the stay imposed by this temporary rule until 20th September 2020. This applies to proceedings that were stayed immediately prior to the date that rule 55.29 first came into force, those brought after that rule came into force and those brought after this amendment comes into force and on or before 19th September 2020.

These Rules also make consequential amendments to the Civil Procedure Rules (Amendment No. 3) Rules (SI 2020//747) following the amendment to rule 55.29.

As this is temporary, emergency legislation, no formal impact assessment is required for Better Regulation purposes.
