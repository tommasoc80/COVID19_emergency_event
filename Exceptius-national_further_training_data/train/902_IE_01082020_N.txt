(2) Part 7 of the Act of 2020 is amended by inserting the following sections after section 28:

“Objectives of section 28B, purposes for which its provisions are enacted and certain duty of Minister for Finance respecting those provisions’ operation

28A. (1) The objectives of section 28B are to provide—

(a) the necessary stimulus to the economy so as to mitigate the effects, on the economy, of Covid-19, and

(b) if, as of 1 January 2021, no agreement stands entered into between the European Union and the United Kingdom (with respect to the future relations between them on the relevant matters), to mitigate the effects on the economy which are apprehended may arise therefrom.

(2) In subsection (1) ‘relevant matters’ means the matters described in Part II of the Political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom1

(3) The purposes for which the several provisions of section 28B (in this section referred to as the ‘wage subsidy scheme’) are, in furtherance of the foregoing objectives, enacted are:

(a) in addition to the provision of basic mechanisms to fulfil those objectives, to ensure the efficient use of the wage subsidy scheme so as to minimise the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme (so far as consistent with fulfilment of those objectives);

(b) to avoid, where possible, allocation of resources to sectors of the economy that are not in need of direct stimulus by means of the wage subsidy scheme (and which sectors may reasonably be expected to be restored to financial viability and an eventual growth path by the indirect effects of the scheme);

(c) to protect the public finances through mechanisms for the discontinuance of one or more of the payments under the wage subsidy scheme (or for their variation) in defined circumstances;

(d) to take account of the need to reflect changes in the circumstances of individuals who, as employees, are individuals in respect of whom payments under the wage subsidy scheme are being made, in cases where such individuals avail themselves of other financial supports provided by the State;

(e) to have regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of child care facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment;

(f) to take account of changes in the State’s economic circumstances and the demands on its financial resources which may occur in the remainder of the current financial year and thereafter.

(4) It shall be the duty of the Minister for Finance to monitor and superintend the administration of the wage subsidy scheme (but this subsection does not derogate from the function of care and management conferred on the Revenue Commissioners by section 28B(19)).

(5) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), the Minister for Finance shall cause an assessment, at such intervals as he or she considers appropriate but no less frequently than every 2 months beginning with the passing of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19)(No. 2) Act 2020, of the following, and any other relevant matters, to be made—

(a) up-to-date data from the register commonly referred to as the ‘Live Register’ and data related to that register supplied to the Department of Finance by the Department of Business, Jobs and Innovation (whether data compiled by that last-mentioned Department of State from its own sources or those available to it from sources maintained elsewhere in the Public Service),

(b) up-to-date data compiled by the Department of Finance relating to the State’s receipts and expenditure,

(c) such other data as the Minister may consider relevant in relation to the impact from, and effects of, Covid-19 or the fact (should that be so) of there not being an agreement of the kind referred to in subsection (1)(b),

and, if the following is commissioned, by reference to an assessment, on economic grounds, of the wage subsidy scheme that may be commissioned by the Minister for Finance and any opinion as to the sustainability of the scheme expressed therein.

(6) Following an assessment under subsection (5), it shall be the duty of the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to determine whether it is necessary to exercise any or all of the powers under paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (21) of section 28B so, as appropriate, to—

(a) fulfil, better, the objectives specified in subsection (1), or

(b) facilitate the furtherance of any of the purposes specified in subsection (2),

and, if the Minister for Finance determines that such is necessary, the powers under one, or more than one, as provided in that subsection (21), of those paragraphs (a) to (c) shall become and be exercisable by the Minister for Finance.

(12) An amount that is required to be refunded by an employer to the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with subsection (11) (in this section referred to as ‘relevant tax’) shall be treated as if it were income tax due and payable by the employer from the date the wage subsidy payment referred to in that subsection had been paid by the Revenue Commissioners to the employer and shall be so due and payable without the making of an assessment.

(13) Notwithstanding subsection (12), where an officer of the Revenue Commissioners is satisfied there is an amount of relevant tax due to be paid by an employer which has not been paid, that officer may make an assessment on the employer to the best of the officer’s judgment, and any amount of relevant tax due under an assessment so made shall be due and payable from the date the wage subsidy payment referred to in subsection (11) had been paid by the Revenue Commissioners to the employer.

(b) appeals against such assessments (including the rehearing of appeals and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court), and

(17) A person shall, without prejudice to any other penalty to which the person may be liable, be guilty of an offence under this section if the person—

(b) knowingly aids, abets, assists, incites or induces another person to make or deliver knowingly or wilfully any incorrect return or statement, or knowingly or wilfully furnish any incorrect information, in connection with the operation of subsection (2) or the eligibility for a wage subsidy payment in relation to any individual,

(18) Notwithstanding any obligation imposed on the Revenue Commissioners under section 851A of the Act or any other enactment in relation to the confidentiality of taxpayer information (within the meaning of that section) or any obligation imposed on the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection under the Social Welfare Acts or any other enactment in relation to the confidentiality of information relating to employers and insured persons or other persons entitled to benefits or assistance under those Acts, information relevant to the effective operation of this section may be exchanged between the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.

‘specified return date for the accounting period’ has the same meaning as it has in section 959A;

‘specified return date for the preceding accounting period’ has the same meaning as is assigned by section 959A to the definition of the expression, ‘specified return date for the accounting period’, but subject to the modification that the reference in that definition to ‘accounting period’ shall be construed as a reference to ‘preceding accounting period’;

(2) Where, for a specified accounting period, a company has an estimated non-relevant trading loss or an estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, the company may, subject to this section, make a claim (referred to in this section as an ‘interim claim’) for such relief as would be available to the company in respect of the preceding accounting period under section 396(2), 396A(3) or 396B, as the case may be, in respect of 50 per cent of the estimated non-relevant trading loss or 50 per cent of the estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, and an interim claim made under this subsection shall be treated—

(i) in the case of an estimated non-relevant trading loss, the loss is incurred in a trade, and

(ii) in the case of an estimated relevant trading loss, it is a relevant trading loss that has been incurred,

and sections 396, 396A and 396B shall apply to an interim claim with any other necessary modifications to give effect to this subsection.

(3) (a) Subject to paragraph (b), an interim claim under this section may be made by a company on or after the commencement of section 11 of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, but—

(4) (a) Where, subsequent to making an interim claim under subsection (2), it comes to the company’s notice that 50 per cent of the amount of its estimated non-relevant trading loss or 50 per cent of the amount of its estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, is greater than the amount in respect of which the interim claim has been made, the company may, subject to this section, increase the amount in respect of which an interim claim is made under subsection (2).

(b) Where it comes to the company’s notice that 50 per cent of the amount of its estimated non-relevant trading loss or 50 per cent of the amount of its estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, is less than the amount in respect of which an interim claim has been made under subsection (2)—

(i) the difference between—

(I) the amount in respect of which an interim claim has been made under subsection (2), and

(II) 50 per cent of the amount of the estimated non-relevant trading loss or 50 per cent of the amount of the estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be,

is, for the purposes of subparagraph (ii), referred to as the ‘excess amount’, and

(ii) the company shall, without unreasonable delay, amend the amount in respect of which the interim claim has been made under subsection (2) so as to reduce the amount claimed by the excess amount.

(5) (a) Where a company makes an interim claim under this section in respect of 50 per cent of an estimated non-relevant trading loss or 50 per cent of an estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, the company shall—

(i) maintain and have available such records as may reasonably be required for the purposes of determining whether such losses have been computed in a reasonable manner and to the best of the company’s knowledge and belief, and

(ii) not later than the specified return date for the accounting period in which the estimated non-relevant trading loss or the estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, is incurred, make such amendment to the amount of relief claimed by the company as is necessary to ensure that the amount of the claim does not exceed the amount of the non-relevant trading loss or the relevant trading loss, as the case may be, incurred by the company in the specified accounting period which is, under section 396, 396A or 396B, as the case may be, available in respect of the preceding accounting period.

(b) The requirement in paragraph (a)(ii) to make an amendment shall apply notwithstanding section 396(9), 396A(5) or 396B(6), as the case may be, but shall not prevent a company from making a notice of amendment under section 959V.

(6) Subsection (2) shall not apply unless the company which makes an interim claim under this section—

(a) makes a declaration that the company has incurred or may reasonably expect to incur an estimated non-relevant trading loss or an estimated relevant trading loss, as the case may be, in the specified accounting period, and

(b) is a tax compliant company.

(7) Where a company makes an interim claim under this section which gives rise to an excess claim—

(a) then, subject to paragraph (b), tax repaid to the company in respect of the excess claim shall carry interest as determined in accordance with section 1080(2)(c) as if a reference to the date when the tax became due and payable were a reference to the date the tax was repaid by the Revenue Commissioners or offset in accordance with section 960H, as the case may be,

(b) where the interim claim was made neither deliberately nor carelessly (within the meaning of section 1077E) and the company, without unreasonable delay upon it coming to the company’s notice that the claim is overstated, reduces the claim by such amount as is necessary to ensure that it is no longer overstated, tax repaid in respect of the excess claim shall carry interest as determined in accordance with section 1080(2)(c) as if a reference to the date when the tax became due and payable were a reference to the date the claim was reduced.

(8) A claim under this section shall be made in such form and contain such particulars as the Revenue Commissioners may prescribe.”.
