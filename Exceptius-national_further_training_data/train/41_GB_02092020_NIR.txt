EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Taxi Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) to extend arrangements for the automatic renewal of existing taxi licences due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) public health emergency.

The Taxi Licensing (Amendment) (Coronavirus) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (“the 2020 amendment Regulations”) provided for the automatic renewal of existing taxi licences that fell within defined parameters without the prior inspection and testing of the vehicle. Licences automatically renewed under those Regulations last for a period of 6 months and are subject to the additional conditions prescribed. They were also granted free of charge.

These Regulations extend those arrangements so that those licences which have already been automatically renewed for a 6 month period can be again renewed automatically for a further 6 months. In addition, any taxi licence granted before 10th October 2020 that expires between 9th March 2020 and 31st May 2021 may now be automatically renewed for a maximum period of 12 months. All taxi licences automatically renewed under these Regulations are granted free of charge and are subject to the additional conditions already prescribed for such licences. Schedule 1A to the 2015 Regulations contains the prescribed additional conditions as inserted by the 2020 amendment Regulations. The aggregate period for which any consecutive automatic renewal licences are granted must not exceed 12 months for any taxi.

These arrangements will apply for a limited time while the effects of the COVID-19 emergency continue to adversely affect the ability of the Driver and Vehicle Agency to perform its vehicle inspection and testing role.
