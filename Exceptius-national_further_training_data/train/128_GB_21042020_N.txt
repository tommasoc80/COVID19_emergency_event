EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations make amendments to the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/360) (the “1999 Regulations”). The 1999 Regulations set out requirements regarding environmental statements for proposed offshore oil and gas projects. This forms part of the approval process for such projects. The amendments disapply the requirement for offshore oil and gas developers to make copies of relevant documents available for public inspection at an address in the United Kingdom where the effects of coronavirus mean that is not reasonably practicable for the public to inspect them. The amendments also clarify that copies of documents do not need to be made available to be obtained in person in these circumstances. Additionally, the amendments provide that copies of the application for consent must be supplied by post where requested, during any period where copies of the application are not made available for public inspection at an address in the United Kingdom. Under the 1999 Regulations, copies of other relevant documents are already required to be supplied by post, and all relevant documents are required to be published on a public website.

An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as this is a temporary, emergency measure and no significant impact on business, charities, voluntary bodies and the public sector is foreseen.
