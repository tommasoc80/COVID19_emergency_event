The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(1) (“the Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.

These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Scotland.

The Scottish Ministers consider that the restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.

In accordance with paragraph 6(2) and (3) of schedule 19 of the Act, the Scottish Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make these Regulations without a draft having been laid before, and approved by, a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations (which come into force on 27 November 2020) amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the principal regulations”).

Regulation 3 adds a new definition of “end of term household” into regulation 2 of the principal regulations and specifies that end of term households are to be treated as a single household for the purposes of the principal regulations, for instance in relation to the gatherings restrictions.

Regulations 4 to 6 amend schedules 4, 5 and 7A of the principal regulations to add facilitating the formation of an end of term household to the list of examples of a purpose for which a contravention of the travel restrictions in Level 3 or 4 areas, or within the common travel area, will constitute a reasonable excuse.
