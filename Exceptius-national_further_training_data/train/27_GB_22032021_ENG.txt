EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations impose restrictions on gatherings and businesses in England. Areas specified in Part 1 of Schedule 4 (those areas in Step 1) are subject to the restrictions set out in Schedule 1. Areas specified in Part 2 of Schedule 4 (those areas in Step 2) are subject to the restrictions in Schedule 2. Areas specified in Part 3 of Schedule 4 (those areas in Step 3) are subject to the restrictions set out in Schedule 3. The provisions for each Step include restrictions on a person's right to participate in gatherings, and restrictions on business. The restrictions are at their most severe in Step 1. The restrictions on businesses include the closure of certain businesses, and restrictions on the service of food and drink for consumption on the premises of a business.

The Regulations also impose restrictions on leaving the United Kingdom without a reasonable excuse (regulation 8). Schedule 5 lists a number of reasonable excuses for travel outside the United Kingdom, and Schedule 6 lists those people who are exempt from the restrictions on travel outside the United Kingdom.

The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel Regulations) (England) Regulations 2020 are amended so that the requirement to self-isolate under regulation 4 of those Regulations ceases to apply to a person (other than a person travelling from a country listed in Schedule B1) who is required to self-isolate under Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020 (“the Self-Isolation Regulations”).

The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Collection of Contact Details etc. and Related Requirements) Regulations 2020 are amended to clarify the means by which a person can be required to provide their contact details, as well as to remove the requirement to request contact details from a lead member of a group seeking to enter premises.

The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020 are amended to clarify the territorial application of the Regulations, as well as to create new exceptions from the requirement to self-isolate, or remain in the place where a person is self-isolating, under those Regulations (including for participants in serial testing schemes). There are also various drafting and consequential amendments to the Self-Isolation Regulations.

The need for the restrictions in these Regulations must be reviewed by the Secretary of State every 35 days.

No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.
