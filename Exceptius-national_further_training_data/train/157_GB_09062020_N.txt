EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)

These Rules amend the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3132) to insert a new, temporary, rule which provides that possession proceedings and enforcement proceedings by way of writ and warrant for possession are stayed until 23rd August 2020. This applies to proceedings that were stayed immediately prior to the new rule coming into force or that are brought after the new rule comes into force and on or before 22nd August 2020.

The new rule further provides that (i) a claim may be brought notwithstanding that it may be stayed; and (ii) for the purposes of the application of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 to proceedings that are stayed by the new rule, time does not run and the court is not required to give any notice.

As this is temporary, emergency legislation, no formal impact assessment is required for Better Regulation purposes.
