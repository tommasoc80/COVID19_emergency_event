EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (International Travel) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the International Travel Regulations”).

They remove Estonia and Latvia from the list of exempt countries, territories and parts of countries or territories in Part 1 of schedule A1 of the International Travel Regulations. This means that persons arriving in Scotland at or after the time these Regulations come into force are no longer exempt from the movement restriction in regulation 6 of the International Travel Regulations if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have departed from or transited through Estonia or Latvia. These removals from the list in schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in Scotland before 4.00 a.m. on 28 November 2020.

These Regulations add Aruba, Bhutan, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Israel and Jerusalem, Kiribati, Micronesia, Mongolia, Namibia, Northern Mariana Islands, Rwanda, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Uruguay, the US Virgin Islands, and Vanuatu to the list of exempt countries, territories and parts of countries or territories in Part 1 of schedule A1 of the International Travel Regulations.

Persons arriving in Scotland from these countries, territories, or parts of countries or territories, at or after the time these Regulations come into force will be exempt from the movement restriction in regulation 6 of the International Travel Regulations.

The Regulations amend the International Travel Regulations to remove the provisions which were made in respect of travellers arriving from Denmark by the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (International Travel) (Scotland) Amendment (No. 22) Regulations 2020 (S.S.I. 2020/358).

The Regulations also make amendments to schedule 2 of the International Travel Regulations to—

a)
amend the exemption for ‘Crown Servants and government contractors’ to make clear that individuals conducting state business overseas are exempt, when certified as such by a government department, whether or not they are ‘Crown Servants or government contractors’ as currently defined,

b)
amend the exemption for Crown Servants or government contractors to include staff and dependants where necessary to facilitate the proper functioning of a diplomatic mission,

c)
amend the exemption relating to subsea telecommunication systems to include non-urgent installation.

These Regulations also amend the list of specified competitions in schedule 3A of the International Travel Regulations.
