(2) The times are—

(a)where prior to departure a booking was made for the passenger to travel on the relevant service, before the booking was made;
[F11(aa)where, at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the relevant service, a booking was made for the passenger to travel on it, between 24 and 48 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of that service;]

(2C) Paragraph (2A) does not apply in relation to a passenger who arrives in England on a relevant service and later departs from England on a relevant outbound service if both journeys are part of the same booking.]

(3) [F13Paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(aa) apply] only if the booking was made after these Regulations come into force and not during an exemption period.

(4) Paragraph (2)(b) applies only if the check-in took place after these Regulations come into force and not during an exemption period.

[F14(4A) Paragraph (2B) applies only if the booking was made—

(a)after that provision comes into force; and
(b)at a relevant time.]
(5) If another person (A) made the booking on behalf of the passenger (whether or not A is also a passenger on the relevant service), the information requirement is to be treated as complied with, as regards the time set out in paragraph (2)(a), if the required information was provided to A in the required manner before the booking was made, along with a written request that A provide that information to the passenger unless A considers that, by virtue of age or mental capacity, the passenger is unlikely to be capable of understanding it.

[F15(5A) If another person (A) made the booking on behalf of the passenger (whether or not A is also a passenger on the relevant service), the information requirement is to be treated as complied with, as regards the time set out in paragraph (2)(aa), if the required information was provided to A in the required manner between 24 and 48 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the relevant service, along with a written request that A provide that information to the passenger unless A considers that, by virtue of age or mental capacity, the passenger is unlikely to be capable of understanding it.]

[F16(6A) In relation to a booking on a relevant outbound service—

(8) An offence under paragraph (7) is punishable on summary conviction by a fine.

(9) In relation to the requirement to provide the required information at the time set out in paragraph (2)(a) [F18, (aa)] or (b), [F19or (2B)(a) or (b),] it is a defence for the purposes of paragraph (7) if the operator can demonstrate that—

(a)the booking or check-in process was not managed directly by the operator; and
(b)the operator took reasonable steps to ensure that the person managing the process would provide the required information at that time and in the required manner.
[F20(9A) If, following the coming into force of any provision which amends the information required to be provided by regulation 3, an operator provides information to a passenger that would have complied with the information requirement [F21or outbound information requirement] but for the coming into force of that amending provision, it is a defence for the operator to show that it was not reasonably practicable for the amended information to be provided.]
