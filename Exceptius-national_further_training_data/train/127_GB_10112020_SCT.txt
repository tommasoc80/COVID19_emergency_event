EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)

This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992. Article 2 amends Class 72C. This Class was inserted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Coronavirus) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2020. Class 72C allows local authorities and certain health service bodies to carry out development for the purposes of—

a)
preventing an emergency,

b)
reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency, or

c)
taking other action in connection with an emergency.

For these purposes, an emergency is an event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the United Kingdom.

The development permitted is subject to conditions which are set out in paragraph (3) of Class 72C. These conditions currently include a requirement that any use of the land for the purposes of Class 72C ceases on or before 31 December 2020. This Order amends that condition so that the requirement will be that any use of the land for the purposes of Class 72C ceases on or before 1 July 2021.
