EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 809/2014 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 with regard to the integrated administration and control system, rural development measures and cross compliance for claim year 2020 in consideration of the situation caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19)

Regulation 809/2014 lays down rules on the timing of on-the-spot checks, the control rates of certain on-the-spot checks within the integrated system including for area-related aid schemes, and the increase or reduction of the control rates. In addition, Regulation 809/2014 contains rules on on-the-spot checks relating to eligibility criteria, and commitments.

Several obligations pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 and Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 rely on specific and different time frames for their fulfilment, and consequently require the on-the-spot checks to be carried out within those time frames. The measures in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic affects the feasibility of performing the required on-the-spot checks accurately and within the corresponding time limits.

These Regulations provide for derogations from those requirements and reduce the minimum rate of the on-the-spot checks compared to the normal control rates for Greening, cross-compliance, Basic Payment Scheme, and young farmer obligations.

An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
