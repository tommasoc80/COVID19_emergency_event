EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)

This Order amends the Value Added Tax (Reduced Rate) (Hospitality and Tourism) (Coronavirus) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/728) to extend the period during which the reduced rate relief will apply.

It also extends the period during which the consequential changes to the flat-rate scheme for small businesses in regulation 55K of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2518) will apply.

The relief is extended in response to the continuing coronavirus health emergency. The reduced rate relief and the consequential changes to the flat-rate scheme will now both have effect until 31st March 2021.
