EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)

These Regulations amend the Discretionary Support Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 270) (“the 2016 Regulations”).

Regulation 2 amends regulation 15 of the 2016 Regulations to increase the annual income threshold by increasing the number of hours per working week from 40 hours to 45 hours. This will increase the amount of earnings a person can have while still being eligible for discretionary support. This will provide additional access to support to those whose income is affected by COVID-19.
