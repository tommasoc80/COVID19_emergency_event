159	Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:We must prepare for Coronavirus and listen to the advice of the Chief Medical Officer – especially about the importance of washing our hands with soap.

163	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said The government and the NHS are working 24/7 to fight this virus, but cannot do this alone. Every single person has a role to play in helping to manage the spread of the virus - whether that’s washing your hands more often, catching your sneezes, and following clinical advice by calling NHS 111 not going to A&E if you develop symptoms.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False

165	These could include looking at emergency registration of health professionals who have retired, the introduction of emergency indemnity coverage for health care workers to provide care or diagnostic services and relaxation of rules around staff to pupil ratios in education and childcare settings.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
166	More widely, government is considering whether to encourage more home working and discourage unnecessary travel as part of a ‘social distancing’ strategy that would delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year, potentially helping combat the virus in warmer weather conditions.

180	Health Secretary Matt Hancock has outlined how volunteers – who already play a central role in helping the health and social care system function – will be given additional employment safeguards so they can leave their main jobs and temporarily volunteer in the event of a widespread pandemic.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
181	Around 3 million individuals volunteer in a health, community health and social care setting. In the event of a pandemic, we want to be able to maximise the number of volunteers and the amount of time they can commit to supporting the health and social care system – without fear of them losing their jobs. Under these proposed measures, government will ensure the jobs of skilled, experienced or qualified volunteers are protected for up to four weeks to allow them to shore up resilience across the health and social care systems. As part of this, leading business groups will be consulted thoroughly about how best to implement these changes.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
182	Further proposed measures the government are thought to be considering include allowing certain civil proceedings in the magistrates’ courts to be conducted via telephone or video, as well as the expansion of audio and video live links in various criminal proceedings. The provisions will ensure individuals who may be forced to self-isolate are still able to appeal to a court, while ensuring courts can continue to operate even in the height of an epidemic so that justice is delivered.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
183	Following last week’s announcement that measures will also consider emergency registration of health professionals who have since retired, the Bill will also look at ensuring that any retired staff who return to work in the NHS will not have their pensions negatively impacted.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
184	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:We will do all we can to contain coronavirus, but as we know, COVID-19 is spreading across the world, so I want to ensure government is doing everything in its power to be ready to delay and mitigate this threat.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
185	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Public safety is my top priority. Responding to coronavirus is a massive national effort and I’m working with colleagues across government to ensure we have a proportionate emergency bill, with the right measures to deal with the impacts of a widespread COVID-19 outbreak.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
186	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: We plan for the worst and work for the best, and the NHS is working 24/7 to fight this virus. Calls to NHS 111 have increased by more than a third and we have already put in place 500 extra staff to help with this increase. Every person has a role to play in managing the spread of COVID-19 – whether that’s washing your hands more often for 20 seconds or catching your sneezes.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
187	The COVID-19 emergency Bill is also expected to have strong safeguards, including sunsetting after two years, and government is clear that it will only use proposed measures if needed – based on clinical and scientific advice.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
188	New NHS data released this week showed that telephone calls to NHS 111 were up by more than a third compared with the same time last year, with an extra 120,000 calls to NHS 111 in the first week of March. Between Thursday 27 February and Thursday 5 March, NHS 111 answered 389,779 calls. To help deal with this demand, the NHS have announced around 500 additional initial call responders have already been trained, an increase of 20%, and people can also visit NHS 111 online.

198	This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak.The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead. We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick.There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
199	Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
200	We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
201	We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
202	Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
203	As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
204	But before that I want to stress the following things:First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
205	Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
206	Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
207	And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
208	There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
209	But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
210	Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming. I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
211	But it is now a global pandemic. And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests.I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
212	Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous. And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
213	But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through. And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
214	Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
215	We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
216	The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
217	Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
218	We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
219	At some point in the next few weeks, we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. We are not introducing this yet for reasons Sir Patrick will explain, but I want to signal now that this is coming down the track.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
220	We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
221	But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
222	At all stages, we have been guided by the science, and we will do the right thing at the right time. We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
223	There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months.The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
224	I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
225	And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
226	So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
227	And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
228	Local, mayoral and Police and Crime Commissioner elections that were due to take place in May this year will be postponed until May 2021, the Government has confirmed today. The Government will also work with the devolved administrations to ensure that they have the necessary powers to take the same approach.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
229	The decision was taken following advice from the Government’s medical experts in relation to the response to the Covid-19 virus and the advice of those delivering elections. Legislation will now be brought forward to postpone the elections for 12 months. Further details will be set out in due course.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
230	Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK. As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
231	Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
232	And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days. So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
233	That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
234	So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.	False	False	True	True	False	False	False	False
235	We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
236	It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
237	Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
238	And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure?The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
239	And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities.And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
240	So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
241	And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
242	And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease. And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
243	And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead. So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
244	Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low. But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
245	And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency. So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
246	And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures. But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
247	Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
248	We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease. To keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need, and the UK is also at the front of the effort to back business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
249	I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important. But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
250	Today the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all non-essential international travel, initially for a period of 30 days. This advice takes effect immediately.	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
251	This change in travel advice reflects the pace at which other countries are either closing their borders or implementing restrictive measures in response to the global coronavirus pandemic.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
252	Often there is little or no notice when countries take these steps and restrictions are also being imposed in areas where no cases of coronavirus have yet been reported. They are therefore very difficult to predict.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
253	British people who decide that they still need to travel abroad should be fully aware of the increased risks of doing so. That includes the risk that they may not be able to get home, if travel restrictions are put in place. Anyone still considering travel needs to be realistic about the level of disruption they are willing and able to endure, and to make decisions in light of the unprecedented conditions we face.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
254	We are not currently advising British people to immediately return to the UK if they are overseas, except for a few countries detailed in our travel advice. However, British people should keep in mind that flights may be cancelled at short notice or other travel restrictions may be put in place by foreign governments.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
255	If people do want to return to the UK soon, then they need to take account of the fast moving situation and plan accordingly, while flights remain available in many places.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
256	Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said: UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lock downs in various countries. The speed and range of those measures across other countries is unprecedented.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
257	Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said So I have taken the decision to advise British nationals against all non-essential international travel.	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
258	Whether travel is essential or not is a personal decision and circumstances differ from person to person. It is for individuals themselves to make an informed decision based on the risks and FCO advice. Anyone still planning to travel should check the validity of their travel insurance.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
259	UK inward and outward travel has already fallen by a significant amount since the outbreak of coronavirus. Ryanair, Virgin and EasyJet have cut flights by 80% this month and IAG has decreased capacity by 75%	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
260	The UK’s extensive diplomatic network is continuing to work around the world to support British people at the greatest risk of exposure to the virus.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
261	In the last week alone 430 changes have been made to FCO Travel Advice.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
262	We will continue to do everything in our power to get those British nationals affected the care, support and advice they need. We are also working urgently to ensure international governments have sensible plans to enable the return of British and other travellers and, crucially, that they keep borders open for enough time to allow people to return home on commercial flights.	False	False	False	False	True	False	False	False
263	British nationals who become ill overseas should, in the first instance, seek care and support from the country they are in.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
264	This guidance follows the domestic measures announced by the Prime Minister on Monday and forms part of the national effort to meet the international challenge presented by coronavirus.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
265	Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
266	I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
267	I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
268	Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands.	False	False	True	True	False	False	False	False
269	And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
270	A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
271	We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
272	And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
273	And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off. And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
274	And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
275	And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
276	So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
277	So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
278	The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that. But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
279	And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
280	So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
281	This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
282	So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career.	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
283	Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
284	And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
285	I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
286	I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
287	By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
288	We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease. But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead. And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
289	Measures to close entertainment, hospitality and indoor leisure premises across the country to take place from the end of trading hours today (Friday 20 March) to limit spread of coronavirus  	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
290	New measures will further limit people’s sustained social contact as we tackle the spread of coronavirus, guided by scientific evidence	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
291	Public urged to stay at home and limit all but essential travel - people who can work from home should do so 	False	False	True	True	False	False	False	False
292	To delay the spread of coronavirus, the government has instructed some businesses and venues including all pubs, bars and restaurants to close from tonight. This follows expert advice that more needs to be done in order to tackle the spread of infection - following  the call  to action to isolate or socially distance.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
293	The closures will help limit the spread of coronavirus by helping to stop non-essential contact and unnecessary travel, in line with the public guidance announced earlier this week.	False	False	True	True	False	False	False	False
294	The measures will be reviewed on a monthly basis, and are being implemented across the whole of the UK in agreement with the devolved administrations. If needed, the government will enforce these measures by law.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
295	This will not affect supermarkets or retailers that supply fuel, medicines and other vital goods, which will continue to be open as normal for the public.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
296	The following businesses and venues have been asked to close: Food and drink venues for consumption on-site, such as restaurants and cafes.Drinking establishments, including pubs, bars, nightclubs.Entertainment venues, including cinemas, theatres, concert halls, and bingo halls.Museums and galleries.Spas and massage parlours.Casinos and betting shops.All indoor leisure and sports facilities, including gyms.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
297	This measure will not impact the relaxation of planning rules announced earlier this week which will allow pubs and restaurants to operate as hot food takeaways during the coronavirus outbreak, which will help to support people who are staying at home through this period.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
298	The government has also urged the public to take further steps to protect themselves and the wider population from the coronavirus, including:  Everyone to stay at home unless they need to get essential supplies such as food and medicines. 	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
299	The government has also urged the public to take further steps to protect themselves and the wider population from the coronavirus, including: All those able to work from home to do so, unless their work is essential. 	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
300	The government has also urged the public to take further steps to protect themselves and the wider population from the coronavirus, including:  Everyone to stay at home unless they need to get essential supplies such as food and medicines. 	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
301	The closures announced today will not impact the running of public transport, and government continues to work closely with transport operators to ensure that people who need to get to work can continue to do so.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
302	Yesterday, the government and rail industry agreed a plan that will see a gradual reduction in train services across the country to reflect lower passenger demand as people change their travel patterns to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, while keeping vital rail services running. The decision to introduce further measures has been taken based on the latest advice from the world-leading health and scientific experts advising the government.	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
303	When infection rates come down, the government will remove measures as soon as it is safe to do so, guided by scientific advice. 	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
304	The government is working urgently to further improve testing and monitoring, which will also help in relaxing the measures as soon as possible. 	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
305	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:  We will do whatever it takes to protect people across this country as we tackle the coronavirus outbreak. 	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
306	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: While people have responded well to calls for social distancing and self-isolation, we must go further if we are to be able to stop the spread of the virus and protect the most vulnerable people in our society, and our NHS	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
307	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:That is why we are now telling entertainment and hospitality premises to close temporarily, and people to only travel if absolutely essential, to help protect each other from the further spread of the virus.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
308	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: We stand behind businesses and their employees and are offering an unprecedented range of support as we tackle this huge challenge together.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
309	Good afternoon and thank you for coming again, Today I am joined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Jennie Harries deputy chief medical officer.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
310	Yesterday I set out the ambition of this government to turn the tide against coronavirus within 3 months. And I want to repeat that determination today. We are going to do it with testing. We are going to do it with new medicines, and with new digital technology that will help us to see the disease as it is transmitted, and thereby, by eliminating it, to stamp it out.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
311	And above all, now we are going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort to slow the spread by reducing unnecessary social contact.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
312	And I want to thank everyone for following the guidance we issued on Monday: to stay at home for 7 days if you think you have the symptoms,	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
313	for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms – a new continuous cough or a high temperature	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
314	To avoid pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
315	To work from home if at all possible.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
316	Keep washing your hands. I know it has been tough.I know it has been inconvenient.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
317	But these actions that we’re all taking together are already helping to take the strain off our NHS. Bit by bit, day by day, by your actions, your restraint and your sacrifice, we are putting this country in a better and stronger position, where we will be able to save literally thousands of lives, of people of all ages, people who don’t deserve to die now.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
318	People whose lives can, must, and will be saved. And as we take these actions together and as we make these sacrifices, we can see the impact on the real economy.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
319	Already, fantastic British companies, already under huge strain, big and small. Workers who are finding that their jobs are under threat or are going, through no fault of their own. And to all of them, we in government say: We will stand by you.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
320	And I say that to companies, remember our joint objective: to beat this virus. And we will do everything in our power to help.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
321	And in just a minute, Rishi is going to explain how we are going to help workers of all kinds to get through this crisis,	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
322	Supporting you directly in a way that Government has never been done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business. And of course these measures are intended to be temporary and of course I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
323	Of course it is. But I must be absolutely clear with you: the speed of that eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
324	And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday which you will remember.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
325	And of course people have already made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
326	But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us. And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations,	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
327	We are collectively telling, telling cafes, pubs, bars, restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow. Though to be clear, they can continue to provide take-out services.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
328	We’re also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
329	Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad things is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
330	And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
331	And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. But please don’t. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
332	So that’s why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home, that’s how we can protect our NHS and save lives.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
333	To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people. And I also know much, right now, workers and business deserve the financial reassurance we are giving them.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
334	But we will get through this. We will get through it together, and we will beat this virus. And to ram that point home: the more effectively we follow the advice that we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
335	Good afternoon everyone Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
336	I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today. And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
337	Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
338	Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this. Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
339	And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis. And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
340	Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
341	I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
342	But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
343	We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False

346	Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing.

347	You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False

349	And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
350	Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us. You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
351	The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this. And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

353	Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
354	And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
355	And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
356	So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope - and save more lives.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
357	And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False

368	You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
369	If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.	True	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
370	To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: close all shops selling non-essential goods,​ including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship;	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
371	To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with;	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
372	and we’ll stop all social events​, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
373	Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
374	No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
375	And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
376	But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
377	Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

379	I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
380	But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
381	And I know that as they have in the past so many times. The people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False

592	Good afternoon, welcome to the daily coronavirus press conference from Downing Street. I’m joined by Sir Patrick Valance, the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, and Professor Chris Whitty, the government’s Chief Medical Officer. Sir Patrick will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
593	But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat the coronavirus, and the decisions we have taken today. Step-by-step, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus. So that fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that is the way we can protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
594	At every step along this way, we have followed, very carefully and deliberately, the scientific and medical advice that we have received. So that we take the right steps at the right moment in time. At the same time, we are dramatically expanding NHS capacity, in terms of the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people get the care they need, at the point in time that they need it most.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
595	And that’s also why we have directed people to stay at home. To deny coronavirus the opportunity to spread, to protect the NHS and save lives.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
596	Now, today’s data shows that: 327, 608 people in the UK have now been tested for the coronavirus. 103,093 people have tested positive. and sadly, of those with the virus, 13,729 have now diedThese are heart-breaking losses for every family affected. And it reminds us exactly why we need to follow the social distancing guidance.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
597	Earlier today, I chaired meetings of the Cabinet and COBR to consider the advice from SAGE on the impact of the existing social distancing measures. There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus. But, SAGE also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
598	SAGE assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community. That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person. But, overall, we still don’t have the infection rate down as far as we need to. As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
599	In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus. That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths. It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
600	So early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period. I want to be clear about this. The advice from SAGE is that relaxing any of the measures currently in place would risk damage to both public health and our economy. Patrick and Chris will be able to go into further detail on all of this shortly.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
601	But based on this advice, the government has determined that current measures must remain in place for at least the next 3 weeks.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
602	Now, in terms of the decisions that lie ahead, we want to be as up front with the British people as we possibly can. So, let me set out 5 specific things which the government will need to be satisfied of before we will consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
603	First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope. We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The NHS staff have been incredible. We must continue to support them as much as we can.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
604	Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
605	Third, we need to have reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
606	Fourth, we need to be confident that the range of operational challenges, including testing capacity and PPE, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
607	Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS. The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people. It would be the worst outcome, not just for public health, but for the economy and for our country as a whole.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
608	So, the current restrictions will remain in place. The government will continue to monitor the data on the impact of the virus. We will soon be able to test 100,000 people every day. That will give us greater understanding of the scope of infection across the country. It will also help us plan how to change the measures when we are ready to. When we are confident on these 5 points.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
609	Guided by science and data, we will look to adjust the measures to make them as effective as possible in protecting public health, while allowing some economic and social activity to resume. We will only do it, when the evidence demonstrates that is safe to do it.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
610	It could involve relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in other areas. But in formulating the right balance we will be at all times guided by the scientific advice and the evidence.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
611	I should add at this point that we recognise all the economic and social impact the current measures are having. That is why we put in place an unprecedented package of support for jobs and businesses, as well as for hospices and charities who are doing so much to support the most vulnerable in our society.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
612	And, I know that many people would like to hear more detail, some people are calling for exact dates, on what will happen next, and when. We are as being as open as we responsibly can at this stage. And it would not be responsible to pre-judge the evidence that SAGE will have and review in just a few weeks’ time.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
613	I know some people will look at other countries, and ask why the UK isn’t doing what they’re doing. I can reassure people that we carefully follow what is happening in other countries. We will always look to learn any lessons in how they are approaching their response. And I’m talking to foreign ministers on a daily basis, I know Chris and Patrick are doing the same with their opposite numbers around the world.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
614	Ultimately, we have to do what is right for the British people, based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions here in the UK, and we will make those decisions at the right time for this country. That’s what we have done so far. That’s what we will continue to do.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
615	I appreciate the impact of these measures is considerable on people and businesses across the country. The costs being shouldered. The sacrifices people are making. Being isolated from friends and family. Whole households, cooped up inside, all week long.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
616	Parents having difficult conversations with their young children, who just don’t understand why they can’t visit grandparents or go outside and meet up with friends as they normally do. Families struggling managing home-schooling, and balancing that with working from home.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
617	I know there are people very concerned about their household finances. Uncertain about their jobs. Worried for their small businesses that remain closed. We get it. We know it’s rough going at this time.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
618	Every time I come to this lectern, and I read out the grim toll of people who have so sadly passed away. I walk away from here, and I think about what their sons and their daughters must be going through right now. Their brothers and sisters. Their grandchildren. All the loved ones left with their unbearable, long-term, grief. It makes me and it makes this government focus even harder on what we must do. And, I know that, together, united, we must keep up this national effort for a while longer.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
619	We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacrificed far too much to ease up now, especially when we’re beginning to see the evidence that our efforts are starting to pay off. And your efforts are paying off. There is light at the end of the tunnel.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
620	But, we’re now at both a delicate and dangerous stage of this pandemic. If we rush to relax the measures in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress we have made. And that would risk a quick return to another lockdown. With all the threat to life a second peak of the virus would bring, and all the economic damage a second lockdown would carry. So we need to be patient a while longer.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
621	So please please stay home, save lives and protect the NHS. So we can safely return to life as close to normal as possible, as soon as possible. It’s been an incredible national team effort. Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance. Let’s stick together, let’s see this through. And let’s defeat the coronavirus for good.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
622	It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
623	You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
624	And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense. And though we grieve for all those we have lost.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
625	It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
626	And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
627	And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
628	And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
629	So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
630	A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
631	I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates. And though it is right to be flexible in our response.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
632	I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress could.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
633	Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
634	We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
635	And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
636	And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
637	The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
638	Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	True
639	Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
640	And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
641	And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
642	So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
643	We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
644	And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given. We have by no means fulfilled all of them.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
645	And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
646	And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
647	We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
648	And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
649	So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
650	And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
651	And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
652	And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
653	You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
654	And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
655	In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
656	Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.	False	False	False	True	False	False	False	False
657	And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
658	Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
659	And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs. It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
660	And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.	False	False	True	False	False	False	False	False
661	And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
662	We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need.	False	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
663	A power to make subordinate legislation conferred by virtue of Part 1 includes power to make— (a)incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision, (b)different provision for different purposes or areas.	True	False	False	False	False	False	False	False
