nan	Meetings will remain accessible whilst ensuring that councillors, staff and the wider public are able to follow government advice by staying at home to stop the spread of coronavirus to protect the NHS and save lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) The Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant may (orally or in writing)—
(a)vary any requirement imposed under this regulation; and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: Local authorities are the backbone of our democracy and they are playing a vital role in the national effort to keep people safe.

nan	(6) An authorised person may only exercise a power in paragraph (1), (4) or (5) if the authorised person considers that it is a necessary and proportionate means of ensuring compliance with regulation 4.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Based on the World Health Organization’s declaration that this is a public health emergency of international concern, the UK Chief Medical Officers have raised the risk to the public from low to moderate. This permits the government to plan for all eventualities. The risk to individuals remains low.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where P is a child, and has left or is outside of, the place where they are self-isolating and accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for them—

(a)an authorised person may direct that individual to take P to the place where P is self-isolating, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) The Secretary of State must, as soon as possible, communicate the direction— (a)to any local authority within whose area the restricted area or any part of the restricted area falls (a “responsible local authority”), and
(b)where the direction is given in relation to a public outdoor place which forms part of crown land, to the appropriate authority.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And, I know that many people would like to hear more detail, some people are calling for exact dates, on what will happen next, and when. We are as being as open as we responsibly can at this stage. And it would not be responsible to pre-judge the evidence that SAGE will have and review in just a few weeks’ time.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This advice refers to mainland China. It excludes Hong Kong and Macau.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)Part 2 of Schedule 16 makes provision enabling the Scottish Ministers to give directions to restrict access to schools and other educational premises.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)The Secretary of State or the Minister for the Cabinet Office may, by regulations made by statutory instrument, provide (b)that polls for relevant elections or relevant referendums that would otherwise be required to be held on dates that fall within a period specified in the regulations are instead to be held on such later date, or within such period, as is specified in the regulations.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: While people have responded well to calls for social distancing and self-isolation, we must go further if we are to be able to stop the spread of the virus and protect the most vulnerable people in our society, and our NHS	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I know there are people very concerned about their household finances. Uncertain about their jobs. Worried for their small businesses that remain closed. We get it. We know it’s rough going at this time.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) More than one address may be specified in the Passenger Locator Form where— (a)a legal obligation requires P to change addresses, or
(b)it is necessary for P to stay overnight at an address on their arrival in England before travelling directly to another address at which they will be self-isolating.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I know that as they have in the past so many times. The people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Regulations were made in Parliament on 2 April 2020 and apply to meetings taking place before 7 May 2021. The government is able to legislate to bring forward this date if medical and scientific advice leads to the relaxation of social distancing rules.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) P must self-isolate (c)where P is a person described in paragraph 9(1) of Schedule 10 to the Immigration Act 2016 (powers of Secretary of State to enable person to meet bail conditions), in accommodation provided or arranged under that paragraph.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised UK nationals to leave China where possible. If the situation continues to escalate the pressure on the Chinese health system may intensify, and it may also become harder for people to travel.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	(3)Regulations under subsection (1) must not specify—
(a)a date later than 6 May 2021, or
(b)a period ending later than 6 May 2021.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: We need people to follow expert medical advice and stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. It is vital that this message hits home and that misinformation and disinformation which undermines it is knocked down quickly.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Now, today’s data shows that: 327, 608 people in the UK have now been tested for the coronavirus. 103,093 people have tested positive. and sadly, of those with the virus, 13,729 have now died
These are heart-breaking losses for every family affected. And it reminds us exactly why we need to follow the social distancing guidance.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak.
The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead. We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick.
There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	If you are in Northern Ireland, call 111.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) Where a relevant person considers that a number of people are gathered together in contravention of regulation 5, the relevant person may—
a)direct the gathering to disperse,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock will launch a refreshed public information campaign, and set out an enhanced government approach to pandemic preparation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local Government Association Chairman Cllr James Jamieson said: Remote council meetings will crucially help ensure all those taking part stay at home, helping to prevent the coronavirus from spreading and save lives	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	1) The powers in regulations 4, 5 and 8 include powers to impose a restriction or requirement in relation to a group of persons, including a special restriction or requirement.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The government is also working to bring in new law so that by-elections, local polls and referendums cannot be held before 6 May 2021. The Coronavirus Act 2020 has already postponed local and Police and Crime Commissioner elections scheduled in the UK for Thursday 7 May 2020 until 6 May 2021.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Keep washing your hands. I know it has been tough.
I know it has been inconvenient.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Cross-government ‘war room’ of communications experts and scientists also set up ahead of public information blitz in coming weeks	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	British nationals who become ill overseas should, in the first instance, seek care and support from the country they are in.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days. So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Public Health England have already concluded over 10,000 tests so far, and all but 23 have been negative. Latest figures are published daily at 2pm.
Expert teams are actively tracing those who have come into contact with a suspected case.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To work from home if at all possible.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) A direction under this regulation may be revoked by the Secretary of State.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Any power to make subordinate legislation conferred by virtue of Part 1 includes power to make—
(a)incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision,
(b)different provision for different purposes or areas.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But based on this advice, the government has determined that current measures must remain in place for at least the next 3 weeks.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous. And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A direction under paragraph (1) must— (c)give details of the right of appeal to a magistrates’ court, and the time within which such an appeal may be brought;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) A constable may exercise the power in paragraph (3), (4) or (6) only if the constable considers that it is a necessary and proportionate means of ensuring compliance with a direction under regulation 5(1) or with regulation 7(3) as the case may be.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates. And though it is right to be flexible in our response.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	They will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms and what to do if they become ill. Mandarin and Cantonese language support will be available to Public Health England (PHE) and leaflets will be available to passengers.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad things is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Due to increasing travel restrictions and difficulty accessing medical assistance, the FCO is working to make an option available for British nationals to leave Hubei Province. This may happen quickly and with short notice. If you’re a British national in Hubei Province and need assistance, contact our 24/7 number +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or the FCO in London on (+44) (0)207 008 1500 to register your desire to leave before 29 January at 11am local time. You will be contacted once arrangements are confirmed.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A direction under paragraph (1) must— (a)specify the public outdoor place or places to which public access is being restricted (“the restricted area”) in sufficient detail to enable the boundaries of the restricted area to be determined;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) A person who presents at immigration control at the Channel Tunnel shuttle terminal area in France(1), with the intention of boarding a shuttle service destined for the United Kingdom, must provide on the Passenger Locator Form their passenger information on so presenting.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) Where the Secretary of State gives a direction to a local authority under this regulation, regulation 2(1) and (4) do not apply in relation to the giving of a direction by the local authority pursuant to the Secretary of State’s direction.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Comes as cross-government approach to tackling virus continues to accelerate, including ensuring detailed guidance is in place to help those self-isolating	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	In light of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office advises against ‘all but essential’ travel to mainland China and now recommends that British Nationals who are able to leave China do so.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Today’s developments follow significant government action over the last week, including: The unveiling of the latest phase of the government’s communications campaign to encourage the public to do their bit to prevent the spread of the virus	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The new measures, which have been ordered by Downing Street and the Health Secretary as part of the battleplan, are: all departments to designate a junior minister to be responsible for their department’s COVID-19 action, for instance on schools or businesses	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)The Scottish Ministers may by regulations(b)further amend subsection (1) so as to replace “31 March 2021” with “30 September 2021”.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Public safety is my top priority. Responding to coronavirus is a massive national effort and I’m working with colleagues across government to ensure we have a proportionate emergency bill, with the right measures to deal with the impacts of a widespread COVID-19 outbreak.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
