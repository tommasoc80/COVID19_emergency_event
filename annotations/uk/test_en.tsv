nan	UK public health measures are world leading and our excellent NHS is well prepared to manage and treat new diseases. We have been carefully monitoring the situation in Wuhan for some time and are ready to put in place proportionate, precautionary measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Dr Nick Phin, Deputy Director, National Infection Service, Public Health England, said:This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily.  Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The risk to the UK population is very low and the risk to travellers to Wuhan is low, but they are advised to take simple precautions such as practicing good hand and personal hygiene and minimise contact with birds and animals in markets in Wuhan as a further precaution.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	Every government department to have a designated ministerial virus lead to help oversee government response to the global threat of COVID-19	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Public safety is our top priority. Our battle plan will ensure that as this escalates, every part of government is working together to share the responsibility of tackling the health, economic, and social impacts of COVID-19.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Since January, public health teams and world leading scientists have been working round the clock on the COVID-19 response, and government has been working with partners across the country to provide tailored advice to the public, travelers coming into the country and those most at risk from COVID-19.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock has outlined how volunteers – who already play a central role in helping the health and social care system function – will be given additional employment safeguards so they can leave their main jobs and temporarily volunteer in the event of a widespread pandemic.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through. And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The decision was taken following advice from the Government’s medical experts in relation to the response to the Covid-19 virus and the advice of those delivering elections. Legislation will now be brought forward to postpone the elections for 12 months. Further details will be set out in due course.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said: UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lock downs in various countries. The speed and range of those measures across other countries is unprecedented.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We will continue to do everything in our power to get those British nationals affected the care, support and advice they need. We are also working urgently to ensure international governments have sensible plans to enable the return of British and other travellers and, crucially, that they keep borders open for enough time to allow people to return home on commercial flights.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This guidance follows the domestic measures announced by the Prime Minister on Monday and forms part of the national effort to meet the international challenge presented by coronavirus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The government has also urged the public to take further steps to protect themselves and the wider population from the coronavirus, including: All those able to work from home to do so, unless their work is essential. 	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The closures announced today will not impact the running of public transport, and government continues to work closely with transport operators to ensure that people who need to get to work can continue to do so.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:That is why we are now telling entertainment and hospitality premises to close temporarily, and people to only travel if absolutely essential, to help protect each other from the further spread of the virus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us. You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And though huge numbers are complying - and I thank you all - the time has now come for us all to do more.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposestravelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	That’s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax them if the evidence shows we are able to.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	These measures follow recent advice from the National Cyber Security Centre, which revealed a range of attacks being perpetrated online by cyber criminals seeking to exploit coronavirus earlier this month. This included guidance on how to spot and deal with suspicious emails related to coronavirus, as well as mitigate and defend against malware and ransomware.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said Councillors and staff are already doing the right thing by following our advice to stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.

nan	I should add at this point that we recognise all the economic and social impact the current measures are having. That is why we put in place an unprecedented package of support for jobs and businesses, as well as for hospices and charities who are doing so much to support the most vulnerable in our society.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Ultimately, we have to do what is right for the British people, based on the advice of our experts, grounded in the conditions here in the UK, and we will make those decisions at the right time for this country. That’s what we have done so far. That’s what we will continue to do.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacrificed far too much to ease up now, especially when we’re beginning to see the evidence that our efforts are starting to pay off. And your efforts are paying off. There is light at the end of the tunnel.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
