nan	And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) A constable or a registered public health consultant or a person authorised by either of them for the purposes of this paragraph, may, before the end of the permitted period of detention, take a person detained in a hospital or other suitable place to one or more other hospitals or other suitable places.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	As of Tuesday 28 January 2020, there are currently no confirmed cases in the UK or of UK citizens abroad, and the risk to the public remains low.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) The powers conferred by this regulation are without prejudice to the power of the Secretary of State under section 71 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Today the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all non-essential international travel, initially for a period of 30 days. This advice takes effect immediately.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local, mayoral and Police and Crime Commissioner elections that were due to take place in May this year will be postponed until May 2021, the Government has confirmed today. The Government will also work with the devolved administrations to ensure that they have the necessary powers to take the same approach.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To reiterate, our advice is for everyone to take sensible precautions like using tissues and washing hands more.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) If the Secretary of State considers that one or more of the conditions in regulation 2(1) is no longer met in relation to a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1) given by a local authority, the Secretary of State must direct the local authority to—(a)revoke the direction without replacement, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) A constable may—
(a)direct P to go immediately to a hospital or other suitable place specified in the direction for the purposes of screening, assessment and the imposition of any restrictions or requirements under regulation 5,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) For the purposes of this regulation, the “specified premises” are—
(a)unless paragraph (b) or (c) applies—
(i)an address specified in P’s Passenger Locator Form as the place they intend to stay in for the duration of the period specified in paragraph (2) as required by regulation 3, where P has completed a Passenger Locator Form,
(ii)an address specified as the place they intend to stay for the duration of the period specified in paragraph (2) where P has completed a form equivalent to a Passenger Locator Form pursuant to an enactment in England, Wales or Northern Ireland,
(iii)the premises at which they intend to stay for such part of the period specified in paragraph (2) as will apply while in Scotland where P is a person described in paragraph (1)(b) who has not completed a Passenger Locator Form or equivalent form as described in head (ii),
(iv)the premises at which they intend to stay for such part of the period specified in paragraph (2) as will apply while in Scotland, where P is a person described in paragraph 1 of schedule 2 (other than one described in regulation 7(1)(c)(i)), or
(v)where it is not possible for P to stay at a place in accordance with paragraph (i) to (iv), in accommodation facilitated by the Secretary of State for P for the purposes of paragraph (2),	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Before giving or revoking a direction under this regulation, the Secretary of State must consult the Chief Medical Officer or one of the Deputy Chief Medical Officers of the Department of Health and Social Care.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said We’ve given local authorities across England an additional £1.6 billion to help their crucial work in the national effort against coronavirus, and we are continuing to ensure they get all of the support that they need at this time.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where paragraph (2) applies, the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, registered public health consultant may impose on or in relation to P one or more screening requirements.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Second, we need to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from coronavirus so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)Section 10ZA of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Northern Ireland: timing of the canvass) is amended in accordance with subsections (2) and (3).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In the UK, please stay indoors and avoid contact with others where possible, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This means taking simple, common sense steps, such as staying at home and avoiding close contact with other people as much as possible.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) In regulation 4 (b)in paragraph (3), references to P are to each person in the group who has arrived on the same aircraft, ship or train and left the same area;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months.The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure?
The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(12) For the purposes of paragraph (11), a reasonable excuse includes where— (a)the person is the owner or occupier of land or premises falling within, or partially within, the restricted area;
(b)the person needs to enter the restricted area to obtain access to the place where they are living, or to leave that place;
(c)the person needs to enter or remain in the restricted area—
(i)to avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm;
(ii)to continue existing arrangements for access to, and contact between, parents and children where the children do not live in the same household as their parents, or one of their parents;
(iii)to fulfil a legal obligation or to participate in legal proceedings;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Parents having difficult conversations with their young children, who just don’t understand why they can’t visit grandparents or go outside and meet up with friends as they normally do. Families struggling managing home-schooling, and balancing that with working from home.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We have updated our guidance for individuals who have returned from Wuhan, China as follows:
If you have returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days:stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with other flu viruses	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Schedule 7 contains other temporary measures in response to coronavirus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	9) During the period of their self-isolation, P may not leave, or be outside of, the place where P is self-isolating except—
(a)to travel in order to leave England, provided that they do so directly,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)Sections 15 to 17 of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (effect of repeals) apply to the suspension of a provision by regulations under subsection (1)(a) as if the provision had been repealed by an Act.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(9) Nothing in this regulation requires a person to provide any information if that information is not within their possession or control.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3), a reasonable excuse includes where(e)it is reasonably necessary for a person to enter or remain in a public outdoor place to which the direction relates—
(i)for work purposes, or for the provision of voluntary or charitable services,
(ii)to facilitate a house move,
(iii)to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, including relevant personal care within the meaning of paragraph 7(3B) of Schedule 4 to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006(1), or
(iv)to provide emergency assistance.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)The power to make regulations under subsection (2) may be exercised more than once in respect of any relevant recall petition.
	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7)Subsection (8) applies where—
(a)notice of the date for the poll for the election has been published under Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 2015 (S.S.I. 2015/425) (“the 2015 Order”), and
(b)under subsection (2)(a), the Presiding Officer fixes a later date for the poll (“the new date”).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	First, we must protect the NHS’s ability to cope. We must be confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. The NHS staff have been incredible. We must continue to support them as much as we can.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	British people should consider whether they judge that travelling to or staying in China is essential.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said The government and the NHS are working 24/7 to fight this virus, but cannot do this alone. Every single person has a role to play in helping to manage the spread of the virus - whether that’s washing your hands more often, catching your sneezes, and following clinical advice by calling NHS 111 not going to A&E if you develop symptoms.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) A person who is travelling with a child for whom they have responsibility, must ensure that passenger information is provided in relation to that child on the Passenger Locator Form— (a)on their arrival in England, in the case of a person described in paragraph (1) or (3), or (b)when they present at immigration control, in the case of a person described in paragraph (2).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) No person may without reasonable excuse enter or remain in a public outdoor place to which a direction under regulation 6(1) relates in contravention of a prohibition, requirement or restriction imposed by the direction.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk. And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10) On an appeal against a direction under paragraph (1) in a case where the direction was made pursuant to a direction of the Secretary of State under regulation 3, a summons is to be issued to both the Secretary of State and the local authority.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
We must prepare for Coronavirus and listen to the advice of the Chief Medical Officer – especially about the importance of washing our hands with soap. We should be doing that for 20 seconds, and more often than we would normally think was necessary. This will make a real difference in stopping this virus spread.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) Where a constable considers that an event is being held in contravention of a direction under regulation 5(1), the constable may—
(a)direct the event to stop,
	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) In regulation 4—
(a)in paragraph (2), references to P are to each person in the group;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local government
(1)The poll for the ordinary election of councillors for any local government area in England that would otherwise be held on the ordinary day of election in 2020 is to be held instead on the ordinary day of election in 2021.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Where a person absconds from detention or isolation imposed under regulation 4, 5 or 8, a constable may take the person into custody and return the person to the place of detention or isolation, or take the person to another suitable place specified by a public health officer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Every time I come to this lectern, and I read out the grim toll of people who have so sadly passed away. I walk away from here, and I think about what their sons and their daughters must be going through right now. Their brothers and sisters. Their grandchildren. All the loved ones left with their unbearable, long-term, grief. It makes me and it makes this government focus even harder on what we must do. And, I know that, together, united, we must keep up this national effort for a while longer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	As of Monday 20 January 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has reported 217 cases of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus. Four of these cases have been diagnosed outside of China – 2 in Thailand, one in Japan and one in South Korea, following travel to Wuhan, China. There have also now been cases in other cities in China. There have been 3 fatalities.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Where a local authority gives a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1) the local authority must—

(a)notify the Secretary of State as soon as reasonably practicable after the direction is given, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)Part 1 of Schedule 16 makes provision enabling the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers to give directions for the restriction of attendance at premises used for the provision of education or childcare.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Certain states routinely use disinformation as a policy tool, so the government is also stepping up its efforts to share its assessments on coronavirus disinformation with international partners. Working collaboratively has already helped make the UK safer, providing ourselves and our allies with a better understanding of how different techniques are used as part of malicious information operations - and how to protect against those techniques more effectively.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And 4 of those have tested positive and been transferred to specialist centres.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Schedule 26 contains temporary modifications of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) Before imposing or varying a requirement under this regulation, the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, registered public health consultant must—
(a)inform P (or where P is a child, a person who is a responsible adult in relation to P) of the requirement or variation that the Secretary of State or registered public health consultant is minded to impose or make; and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The change applies to all local authorities in England, which includes county councils, district councils, combined authorities, parish councils, joint committees constituted to be a local planning authority, fire and rescue authorities and national park authorities. They apply to meetings of a local authority, an executive of a local authority, a joint committee of two or more local authorities, and a committee or sub-committee of any of those bodies.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The government has also urged the public to take further steps to protect themselves and the wider population from the coronavirus, including:  Everyone to stay at home unless they need to get essential supplies such as food and medicines. 	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: close all shops selling non-essential goods,​ including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10)Regulations under subsection (9)—
(a)may make different provision for different purposes or areas,
(b)are subject to the negative procedure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Public Health England have already concluded over 21,000 tests so far, with all but 206 coming back negative. Latest figures are published daily.
We have also announced over the last week that 2 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 have sadly died. Both were older individuals with underlying health issues.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) This regulation applies where a person (“P”)— (a)arrives in England from outside the common travel area, or
(b)arrives in England from within the common travel area, and has at any time in the period beginning with the 14th day before the date of their arrival in England, been outside the common travel area.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) The requirements specified in this paragraph are for P to— (b)supply information to a public health officer which may assist in assessing P’s health;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Currently, the risk to the UK population is very low and the risk to travellers to Wuhan is low, but the situation is under constant review. However, in line with our robust preparedness activities for emerging infections, we have issued clinical guidance for the detection and diagnosis of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus. There are no confirmed cases of this new infection in the UK.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7)Subsection (8) applies if regulations under subsection (3) are made in accordance with paragraph 23 of schedule 7 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The following businesses and venues have been asked to close: 
Food and drink venues for consumption on-site, such as restaurants and cafes.
Drinking establishments, including pubs, bars, nightclubs.
Entertainment venues, including cinemas, theatres, concert halls, and bingo halls.
Museums and galleries.
Spas and massage parlours.
Casinos and betting shops.
All indoor leisure and sports facilities, including gyms.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) Before imposing or varying a requirement under this regulation, the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, registered public health consultant must (b)have regard to any relevant representations by P (or, where P is a child, a person who is a responsible adult in relation to P), as to its suitability.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where a local authority gives a direction under paragraph (1) it must take reasonable steps—
(a)to give advance notice of the direction to a person carrying on a business from premises within a public outdoor place to which the direction relates, and
(b)to ensure that the direction is brought to the attention of any person who owns, occupies or is responsible for any land or premises in a public outdoor place to which the direction relates.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	—(1) This regulation applies if a constable has reasonable grounds to suspect that— it is necessary to direct, remove or detain P in the interests of P, for the protection of other persons or for the maintenance of public safety	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) A direction under paragraph (1) may be given only for the purposes of (b)restricting entry to the premises, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) A direction under paragraph (1) may only have the effect of imposing a prohibition, requirement or restriction on— (a)the owner or any occupier of premises to which the direction relates, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)The returning officer must fix a date under subsection (2) for the poll at the election to be held as soon as reasonably practicable.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	More widely, government is considering whether to encourage more home working and discourage unnecessary travel as part of a ‘social distancing’ strategy that would delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year, potentially helping combat the virus in warmer weather conditions.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(c)by P as soon as reasonably practicable upon arriving in Scotland submitting electronically, using a facility provided by the Secretary of State for this purpose, a Passenger Locator Form, containing—
(i)P’s passenger information, and (ii)where P is accompanied by any child for whom P has responsibility, passenger information pertaining to that child.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off. And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) The reference in paragraph (3)(c) to a person involved in the holding of an event does not include a person whose only involvement in the event is, or would be, by attendance at the event.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) Nothing in this regulation affects the operation of any requirement or restriction on P by virtue of schedule 21 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(4) (powers relating to potentially infectious persons) or by virtue of an order made under Part 4 of the Public Health etc. (Scotland) Act 2008(5).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	A power to make subordinate legislation conferred by virtue of Part 1 includes power to make— (a)incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision, (b)different provision for different purposes or areas.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) The requirements specified in this paragraph are for P to (d)comply with any other specified condition or to take any other specified measure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) P must, on their arrival in England, travel directly to the place at which they are to self-isolate, and must then self-isolate until whichever is the earlier of—

(a)the end of the 14th day after the day on which they arrive in the common travel area, or
(b)their departure from England.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Unless an individual has been contacted already or has travelled to an affected area, they should be reassured it is not necessary for them to take any further action.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Penny Mordaunt, Paymaster General said That is why government communicators are working in tandem with health bodies to promote official medical advice, rebut false narratives and clamp down on criminals seeking to exploit public concern during this pandemic.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where a constable considers that a person is, without reasonable excuse, in a public outdoor place in contravention of regulation 7(3), the constable may (b)remove that person from the place.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Prime Minister has also ordered a war room to be convened in the Cabinet Office, featuring a cross-Whitehall team of communications experts to roll out the public information campaign and respond quickly to cross-department issues.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(b)the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland to give directions requiring the temporary closure of further and higher education institutions;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Schedule 27 makes provision for, and in connection with, the use of live links in proceedings in courts and tribunals in Northern Ireland.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) A constable exercising the power in paragraph (1) may use reasonable force, if necessary, in doing so.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Saturday 4 April 2020 is the day that the local authorities gain the power to hold remote meetings. However, for most local authorities the practical effect will be from the start of the working week when they hold most meetings.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person (“P”) has contravened the requirement in regulation 6(2) the constable may remove P to the place where P is staying in accordance with regulation 6(2), or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So that’s why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home, that’s how we can protect our NHS and save lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The majority of reported human cases in China have had close contact with wild birds or poultry. Although the risk is very low, Public Health England and the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) are reminding UK travellers to protect themselves from avian flu by minimising exposure to wild birds and poultry.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Any person, other than a local authority mentioned in paragraph (1), who owns, occupies or is responsible for land in a public outdoor place to which a direction under regulation 6(1) relates must take reasonable steps to prevent or restrict public access to that land in accordance with the direction.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Of course it is. But I must be absolutely clear with you: the speed of that eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)This subsection applies to— (e)an election to fill a casual vacancy in the office of an elected mayor under Part 1A of the Local Government Act 2000;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) Where a special restriction or requirement is imposed under paragraph (1)(c), the person imposing the restriction or requirement must express it to be contingent on the incidence or transmission of Coronavirus constituting a serious and imminent threat to public health as referred to in regulation 3.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)Regulations under this section are subject to the negative procedure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Supporting you directly in a way that Government has never been done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business. And of course these measures are intended to be temporary and of course I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)Subsection (1) is subject to section 10 (power to bring forward expiry).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A direction under paragraph (1) must— (d)be published on www.gov.uk, in the Gazette, and in such other way as appears to the Secretary of State likely to bring the direction to the attention of the persons who are likely to be affected by it.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	For the purposes of this section an election or referendum is “relevant” if— (b)subsection (3) or (4) applies to it.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8)In this section—
“local authority” means a council constituted under section 2 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and “area” in relation to a local authority means the local government area for which the authority is constituted;
“returning officer”, in relation to a local authority, means an officer appointed by the local authority under section 41(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And our approach has at all times been guided by the Chief Medical Officer, working on the basis of the best possible scientific evidence.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) Where a constable considers that an event is being held in contravention of a direction under regulation 5(1), the constable may 
(c)remove a person from the event.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Often there is little or no notice when countries take these steps and restrictions are also being imposed in areas where no cases of coronavirus have yet been reported. They are therefore very difficult to predict.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10) On an appeal against a direction under paragraph (1) in a case where the direction was made pursuant to a direction of the Secretary of State under regulation 3, a summons is to be issued to both the Secretary of State and the local authority.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To help the public spot false information the government is running the SHARE checklist and Don’t Feed The Beast campaign here. This gives the public five easy steps to follow to identify whether information may be misleading:	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	SAGE assess that the rate of infection, or the R value, is almost certainly below 1 in the community. That means that on average each infected person is, in turn, infecting less than one other person. But, overall, we still don’t have the infection rate down as far as we need to. As in other countries, we have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)This section applies where under section 10 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”), an election is to be held to fill a vacant seat of a constituency member (“the election”).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Earlier today, I chaired meetings of the Cabinet and COBR to consider the advice from SAGE on the impact of the existing social distancing measures. There are indications that the measures we have put in place have been successful in slowing down the spread of the virus. But, SAGE also say that it is a mixed and inconsistent picture and, in some settings, infections are still likely to be increasing.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)This subsection applies to— (c)an election to fill a casual vacancy in respect of a constituency member of the Greater London Assembly;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) A local authority may give a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1) only if the authority considers that the following conditions are met (c)that the prohibitions, requirements or restrictions imposed by the direction are a proportionate means of achieving that purpose.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a child has repeatedly contravened the requirement in regulation 6(2), the constable may direct any individual who has responsibility for the child to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that the child complies with that requirement.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	While the government and the NHS have plans in place for all eventualities, everyone can play their part.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) A relevant person may take such action as is necessary to enforce any requirement imposed by regulation 4, 5 or 6(10) or (11).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) The Secretary of State may not make a direction under paragraph (1) in relation to a public outdoor place which forms part of Crown land and includes property subject to section 73 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, unless an agreement has been made under that section with the appropriate authority.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) For those purposes those regulations have effect as follows.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	People travelling to Wuhan should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK, informing their health service prior to their attendance about their recent travel to the city.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Before exercising the power in paragraph (2) the constable must where consultation has not been carried out under sub-paragraph (a)—have due regard to the views of the registered public health consultant and any information provided by the registered public health consultant in relation to P.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Leading scientific experts and senior civil servants will also increase the number of high-level meetings to support ministers in their preparations.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) Where a local authority gives a direction under paragraph (1) it must take reasonable steps to give advance notice of the direction to —
(a)a person carrying on a business from the premises to which the direction relates, and
(b)if different, any person who owns or occupies the premises.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A direction under paragraph (1) may impose a prohibition, requirement or restriction by reference to, among other things—
(a)the number of persons in the premises,
(b)the purpose for which a person is in the premises, and
(c)the facilities in the premises.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	It could involve relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in other areas. But in formulating the right balance we will be at all times guided by the scientific advice and the evidence.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where a restriction or requirement under paragraph (1)(c) is imposed on or in relation to a child, a person who is a responsible adult in relation to the child must secure that the child complies with the restriction or requirement, insofar as that person is reasonably able to do s	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Mayor of London and the London Assembly
(6)The poll for the ordinary election that would otherwise, pursuant to section 3(2) of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (time of ordinary election for the Mayor of London and the London Assembly), be held on 7 May 2020 is to be held instead on 6 May 2021.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)A councillor who would otherwise, pursuant to section 7 or 16 of the Local Government Act 1972 (elections of councillors), retire on the fourth day after the ordinary day of election in 2020 is instead to retire on the fourth day after the ordinary day of election in 2021; and the councillor's term of office is extended accordingly.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) A direction under paragraph (1) imposing a prohibition, requirement or restriction must—
(a)state the date and time on which the prohibition, requirement or restriction comes into effect, and the date and time on which it will end, and
(b)give details of the right of appeal to a magistrates’ court, and the time within which such an appeal may be brought.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) A person responsible for carrying on a business or providing a service which is listed in Schedule 2 must cease to carry on that business or to provide that service during the emergency period.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	When false narratives are identified, the government’s Rapid Response Unit coordinates with departments across Whitehall to deploy the appropriate response. This can include a direct rebuttal on social media, working with platforms to remove harmful content and ensuring public health campaigns are promoted through reliable sources.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, said So I have taken the decision to advise British nationals against all non-essential international travel.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The regulations also enable Police and Crime Panels in England and Wales to take place remotely, so they can also continue their important work in local areas.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Commercial airline options for departing China remain available throughout the country, except in Hubei Province.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10) In this regulation—
“the authorised extended period” means such further period as is specified in an authorisation under paragraph (11);	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	3) Where a constable considers that an event is being held in contravention of a direction under regulation 5(1), the constable may— (b)direct a person to leave the event, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) P must self-isolate (a)unless sub-paragraph (b) or (c) applies— (ii)in the case of a person described in paragraph (1)(b), or a person described in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 (other than one described in paragraph (13)(a)(i)), at a place at which they intend to self-isolate while in England,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) A direction under paragraph (1) may only have the effect of imposing a prohibition, requirement or restriction on (b)any other person involved in managing entry into, or departure from, such premises or the location of persons in them.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) A constable exercising a power under paragraph (3), (4), or (6) may give the person concerned any reasonable instructions the constable considers to be necessary.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) If on a review of a direction under paragraph (2)(b) a local authority considers that one or more of the conditions in paragraph (1) is no longer met in relation to the direction, the local authority must by notice— (a)revoke the direction without replacement, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)For the purposes of this section an election is “relevant” if— (a)the date of the poll for the election falls within the period beginning with 16 March 2020 and ending with 5 May 2021, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: The UK is a world leader in preparing for and managing disease outbreaks and I have every confidence in our nation’s ability to respond to the threat of COVID-19.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) Paragraph (2) does not require P to remain in isolation—
(a)from any person with whom they were travelling when they arrived in England and who is also self-isolating in the place where P is self-isolating,
(b)where P is self-isolating in their home, from any member of their household,
(c)where P is self-isolating in the home of a friend or family member, from any member of the household of that friend or family member.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: Due to the increasing travel restrictions and the public health situation, we now advise against all but essential travel to China.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	1) This regulation applies where a person (“P”) arrives in Scotland— (a)from outside the common travel area, or$ (b)from within the common travel area, if P has been outside the common travel area at any time in the period beginning with the 14th day before P’s arrival into Scotland.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) The Secretary of State must review the need for the restrictions at least once every seven days, with the first review being carried out on the seventh day after the day on which the direction is made.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Further proposed measures the government are thought to be considering include allowing certain civil proceedings in the magistrates’ courts to be conducted via telephone or video, as well as the expansion of audio and video live links in various criminal proceedings. The provisions will ensure individuals who may be forced to self-isolate are still able to appeal to a court, while ensuring courts can continue to operate even in the height of an epidemic so that justice is delivered.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(13) Any person who is the owner or occupier of any land included within the restricted area may appeal against the making of the direction to a magistrates’ court by way of complaint for an order and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 applies to the proceedings.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) For the purpose of exercising the power in paragraph (2), a constable may enter any place.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:  We will do whatever it takes to protect people across this country as we tackle the coronavirus outbreak. 	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)The power under subsection (4)(b) and (c) includes power to modify any enactment (including this Act).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10) A person described in regulation 4(12) or in any of paragraphs 1 to 4 of Schedule 2 is not required to comply with this regulation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(9) A person on whom a direction under paragraph (1) imposes a prohibition, requirement or restriction may—
(a)appeal against the direction to a magistrates’ court by way of complaint for an order and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 applies to the proceedings, and
(b)make representations to the Secretary of State about the direction.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6)Regulations under this section—
(a)which add to, replace or omit any part of the text of an Act are subject to the affirmative procedure,
(b)otherwise, are subject to the negative procedure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	These could include looking at emergency registration of health professionals who have retired, the introduction of emergency indemnity coverage for health care workers to provide care or diagnostic services and relaxation of rules around staff to pupil ratios in education and childcare settings.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local authorities in England have been handed new powers to hold public meetings virtually by using video or telephone conferencing technology from Saturday (4 April 2020).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Cell is engaging with social media platforms and with disinformation specialists from civil society and academia, to establish a comprehensive overview of the extent, scope and impact of disinformation related to coronavirus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In light of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) now advises against ‘all but essential’ travel to mainland China.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I know some people will look at other countries, and ask why the UK isn’t doing what they’re doing. I can reassure people that we carefully follow what is happening in other countries. We will always look to learn any lessons in how they are approaching their response. And I’m talking to foreign ministers on a daily basis, I know Chris and Patrick are doing the same with their opposite numbers around the world.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. But please don’t. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) In determining whether all reasonable measures have been taken to limit the risk of transmission of the coronavirus for the purposes of paragraph (3)(a)(iii), any guidance issued by the government relevant to the gathering in question must be taken into account.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the area	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To avoid pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency. So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) Where Condition A or B (set out in regulation 4) is met in relation to a person (“P”), the Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant may—(a)(orally or in writing) impose on or in relation to P one or more screening requirements to inform an assessment, by the Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant, of whether P presents or could present a risk of infecting or contaminating others; 	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures. But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Where P is a person described in paragraph 38 of schedule 2, paragraph (3)(a)(i) applies with the modification that the address at which P intends to stay for the purposes of regulation 6(2) must be the named farm (within the meaning of paragraph 38 of schedule 2).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) In determining whether to give a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1) or to revoke such a direction, a local authority must have regard to any advice given to it by its director of public health (or its interim or acting director of public health).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) The Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant may require P to be kept in isolation, if the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, registered public health consultant — considers that it is necessary and proportionate to do so in order to reduce or remove the risk of P infecting or contaminating others.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) During the emergency period, no person may participate in a gathering which—

(a)consists of more than thirty persons,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The requirements specified in this paragraph are for P to—
(a)provide P’s contact details to a public health officer;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Penny Mordaunt, Paymaster General said: Holding your breath for ten seconds is not a test for coronavirus and gargling water for 15 seconds is not a cure - this is the kind of false advice we have seen coming from sources claiming to be medical experts.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	British tourists are currently being quarantined in a hotel in Tenerife and the Foreign Office is in contact with them.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	(4) P is not required to comply with the requirement in paragraph (2) where P is— (a)a child and the child’s passenger information has been provided under paragraph (3)(a)(ii), (b)(ii) or (c)(ii) by another person, (b)a person described in described in regulation 7(1)(a), or (c)a person described in any of paragraphs 1 to 4 of schedule 2.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

(a)after paragraph (a) insert—
“(aa)the year 2021;
(ab)the year 2030;”;
(b)in paragraph (b), for “2010” substitute “2030”.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) P may not leave, or be outside of, the premises where they are staying in accordance with paragraph (2) in reliance on any reasonable excuse described in regulation 8(4) or (5) of the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (offences and penalties) except to the extent that such excuse falls within the reasons specified in regulation 10(4)(3).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress could.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Already, fantastic British companies, already under huge strain, big and small. Workers who are finding that their jobs are under threat or are going, through no fault of their own. And to all of them, we in government say: We will stand by you.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8)The Scottish Ministers must, at the same time as laying the regulations before the Parliament in accordance with paragraph 26 of that schedule, lay before the Parliament a statement of their reasons for making the regulations.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4)The power to make regulations under subsection (1) may be exercised more than once in respect of any relevant election.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) Where a person who is in a gathering in contravention of regulation 5, or in a restricted area in contravention of regulation 6(11), is a child accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for the child—
(a)the relevant person may direct that individual to take the child to the place where the child is living, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)This section applies where under section 37 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (“the 1973 Act”), an election is to be held to fill a casual vacancy in the office of councillor in a local authority (“the election”).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Mr Speaker, with your permission, I’d like to update the House on COVID-19 coronavirus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	British people who decide that they still need to travel abroad should be fully aware of the increased risks of doing so. That includes the risk that they may not be able to get home, if travel restrictions are put in place. Anyone still considering travel needs to be realistic about the level of disruption they are willing and able to endure, and to make decisions in light of the unprecedented conditions we face.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK. As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)The Scottish Ministers may by regulations—
(a)suspend the operation of any provision of Part 1,
(b)revive the operation of a provision so suspended.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing. But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the country	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Existing rules about the number of councillors or members of a group required to attend to make a meeting valid will remain, but virtual attendance will count.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	Fifth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS. The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of the virus to hit the NHS and hit the British people. It would be the worst outcome, not just for public health, but for the economy and for our country as a whole.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	Measures to close entertainment, hospitality and indoor leisure premises across the country to take place from the end of trading hours today (Friday 20 March) to limit spread of coronavirus  	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The NHS is testing a very large number of people who travel back from affected countries, the vast majority of whom test negative.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) A local authority may not give a direction under paragraph (1) in relation to— (a)any premises which forms part of essential infrastructure,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Coronavirus may very well be a challenge in the weeks and months ahead. But I have no doubt that with the help of the NHS and its incomparable staff this country will get through it – and beat it.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(12) An authorisation under paragraph (11) may be given only if the person giving the authorisation considers that the extension is necessary because it is not reasonably practicable for the imposition of any restrictions or requirements under regulation 5 to be completed before the end of the initial period.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Schedule 4 contains temporary modifications to the law in relation to the justice system.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) If P is a child, any person who has responsibility for the child must ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that the child complies with this regulation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Every department will have a designated ministerial virus lead to help oversee the cross-government response to the outbreak, with the government increasing the number of COBRs meetings.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)The Scottish Ministers may by regulations (b)further amend subsection (1) so as to replace “31 March 2021” with “30 September 2021”.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)If either of the Archbishops is unable to exercise the power to join in making a request under subsection (1), or if the see of either of the Archbishops is vacant, the power may be exercised by the senior bishop of the province, with seniority for that purpose being determined in accordance with section 10(4) of the Bishops (Retirement) Measure 1986.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Schedule 23 contains temporary modifications of—
(a)the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
(b)the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, and
(c)the Criminal Justice Act 1988.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	There are 3 direct flights a week that arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan. The enhanced monitoring of direct flights will be kept under continuous review and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are also working urgently to finalise arrangements for an assisted departure from Hubei Province for British nationals this week, and are in contact with people in Hubei to ensure they register their interest and that we can keep them updated.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	People whose lives can, must, and will be saved. And as we take these actions together and as we make these sacrifices, we can see the impact on the real economy.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease. But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead. And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given. We have by no means fulfilled all of them.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(9)In this section “constituency returning officer” has the same meaning as in the 2015 Order.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Before exercising the power in paragraph (2) the constable must—
(a)so far as reasonably practicable, consult a registered public health consultant and have due regard to the views of the registered public health consultant and any information provided by the registered public health consultant in relation to P;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	UK inward and outward travel has already fallen by a significant amount since the outbreak of coronavirus. Ryanair, Virgin and EasyJet have cut flights by 80% this month and IAG has decreased capacity by 75%
	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A direction under paragraph (1) must (b)state the date and time on which the restrictions come into effect, and the date and time on which they will end;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7)The returning officer must—
(a)publish a notice stating that the date has changed, and
(b)comply with the requirements of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 2011 Order as if the new date had just been fixed under section 37 of the 1973 Act.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	NHS also announce calls to NHS 111 increase by more than a third compared to same period last year, with 500 extra call staff recruited to handle higher demand	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) During the emergency period, no person may participate in a gathering which— (c)would be a gathering of a kind mentioned in section 63(1) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994(2) if it took place on land in the open air.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So far 13 people in the UK have tested positive, of whom 8 now have been discharged from hospital.We expect more cases here. As planned, 115 people left supported isolation at Kents Hill Park in Milton Keynes on 23 February. All tested negative for COVID-19.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Today’s developments follow significant government action over the last week, including:
A PM-led press conference with the Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance announcing the publication of the government’s Coronavirus action plan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are working closely with the World Health Organization, the G7 and the wider international community to ensure that we are ready for all eventualities. We are co-ordinating research efforts with international partners.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Before making a direction under paragraph (1), the Secretary of State must consult with the Chief Medical Officer or one of the Deputy Chief Medical Officers of the Department of Health and Social Care.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6)Before laying a draft Scottish statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (3) before the Scottish Parliament in accordance with section 29(2) of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (instruments subject to affirmative procedure), the Scottish Ministers must lay before the Parliament a statement of their reasons why the regulations should be made.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)The Secretary of State or the Minister for the Cabinet Office may, by regulations made by statutory instrument, provide that the designated day for a relevant recall petition is postponed until a date specified in the regulations.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that. But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Prime Minister will chair a meeting of COBR on Monday as part of this co-ordinated response, and has today received a situation briefing by the Chief Medical Officer and the Secretary of State from the Department of Health and Social Care.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms – a new continuous cough or a high temperature	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4)This subsection applies to—
(a)a poll under section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003 (local polls);	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But we will get through this. We will get through it together, and we will beat this virus. And to ram that point home: the more effectively we follow the advice that we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) A local authority designated officer or a constable may take such action as is necessary to enforce a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8)The constituency returning officer must—
(a)publish a notice stating that the date has changed, and
(b)comply with the requirements of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the 2015 Order as if the new date had just been fixed under section 9 of the 1998 Act.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)Regulations under subsection (1) must not specify—
(a)a date later than 6 May 2021, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) Where a relevant person considers that a number of people are gathered together in contravention of regulation 5, the relevant person may (b)direct any person in the gathering to return to the place where they are living, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis. And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In order to minimise the risk of transmission, people travelling to the area should maintain good hand and personal hygiene. Travellers should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, informing their health service prior to their attendance about their recent travel to the city.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) Paragraph (1) does not affect the exercise of any powers by virtue of regulation 8.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7)A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (1) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the National Assembly for Wales.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(11) No person may enter or remain in the restricted area in contravention of the restrictions in the direction without reasonable excuse while the direction has effect.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The risk to the UK population is very low. The UK has robust arrangements to manage emerging diseases and we can draw on our experience of developing pioneering diagnostic tests in humans for the coronaviruses - SARS and MERS.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together. To halt the spread of this disease. To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7)In this section—
“the 2015 Act” means the Recall of MPs Act 2015;
“the designated day” has the same meaning as in the 2015 Act (see section 7(5) of that Act);
“petition officer” has the same meaning as in the 2015 Act (see section 6(2) of that Act);
“recall petition” has the same meaning as in the 2015 Act (see section 1(2) of that Act);
“Speaker’s notice” has the same meaning as in the 2015 Act (see section 5(7) of that Act).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) The Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant may (orally or in writing)— (b)impose on P any additional requirements specified in paragraph (2).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Schools should be guided by the advice on the GOV.UK website and contact their regional school commissioner in case of queries.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Those returning from Iran, from the lockdown areas in northern Italy, and special care zone in South Korea should self-isolate and call NHS 111, even if they have no symptoms.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good afternoon and thank you for coming again, Today I am joined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Jennie Harries deputy chief medical officer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) The power in paragraph (2) may be exercised where P is at any place.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) Subject to regulation 2, a local authority may give a direction imposing prohibitions, requirements or restrictions in relation to the entry into, departure from, or location of persons in, specified premises in the local authority’s area.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) If passenger information changes or becomes available to a person required to self-isolate during that person’s period of self-isolation in England that person must, as soon as reasonably possible take all reasonable steps to complete a Passenger Locator Form, or a new Passenger Locator Form, as the case may be.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)Her Majesty may by Order in Council, at the joint request of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, postpone to the date specified in the Order the date on which the Convocations of Canterbury and York stand dissolved for the purposes of the Church of England Convocations Act 1966.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this. And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday which you will remember.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)Before exercising the power under subsection (2), the Presiding Officer must consult the Welsh Ministers.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Whether travel is essential or not is a personal decision and circumstances differ from person to person. It is for individuals themselves to make an informed decision based on the risks and FCO advice. Anyone still planning to travel should check the validity of their travel insurance.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) If a person described in any of paragraphs (1) to (3) provides their passenger information, and any passenger information required by virtue of paragraph (5), on the Passenger Locator Form in the 48 hours before they are required to do so, then they are treated as having complied with those paragraphs (as applicable).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) are advising against all but essential travel to the Hubei Province. Anyone travelling to China should remain vigilant and check the latest travel advice on GOV.UK.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Dr Nick Phin, Deputy Director, National Infection Service, Public Health England, said: Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is very low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said It’s critical that they continue to provide essential services and find innovative ways to maintain important economic functions they perform like the planning system and they will now be able to do so.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Third, we need to have reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)Regulations under subsection (3) are subject to the affirmative procedure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In Scotland, phone your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	British people currently in China should make decisions based on their own personal circumstances, bearing in mind that travel may become more difficult in the coming days.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Specialist units across government are working at pace to combat false and misleading narratives about coronavirus, ensuring the public has the right information to protect themselves and save lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) For the purposes of this regulation, “authorised person” means—

(a)a constable, or
(b)a person designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this regulation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Where a restriction or requirement is imposed orally on a person under this regulation, or a restriction or requirement imposed under this regulation is orally varied, the person (or, in the case of a child, a person who is a responsible adult in relation to the child) must be provided with a written notification of the restriction or requirement that has been imposed or varied as soon as reasonably practicable.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us. And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In the past few days we have published guidance for schools, for employers, for first responders, for social care and the travel industry on how to handle suspected cases.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) Where a requirement under this regulation is imposed on or in relation to a child, or varied in relation to a child, a person who is a responsible adult in relation to the child must secure that the child complies with the requirement, insofar as that person is reasonably able to do so.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) The address specified by P in the Passenger Locator Form as the intended place of self-isolation must be—(a)their home,
(b)the home of a friend or family member, or
(c)a hotel, hostel, bed and breakfast accommodation, or other suitable place.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) A relevant person may only exercise the power in paragraph (3), (4), (6) or (7) if the relevant person considers that it is a necessary and proportionate means of ensuring compliance with the restriction in regulation 5 or 6(11).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)In subsection (4)—
(a)omit paragraph (b) (including the “and” at the end);
(b)after paragraph (c) insert—
“(d)2021,
(e)2030, and
(f)every tenth year following 2030.”	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) A constable exercising a power under paragraph (1), (4) or (5) may give to P or A any direction or instruction the constable considers necessary and proportionate.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Leaflets and information will be made available across all UK airports, advising travellers from China on what do to if they feel unwell.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) The conditions or measures which may be specified under paragraph (2)(d) include	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	If you have travelled from Wuhan or Hubei Province, China to the UK in the last 14 days you should immediately, even if you do not have symptoms of the virus: stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu
	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)For the purposes of this section an election is “relevant” if— (b)it is an election to fill a casual vacancy in the office of councillor in a county council, county borough council or community council in Wales.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Paragraph (1) does not prevent the use of— (a)any suitable premises used for the businesses or services listed in Schedule 2 to host blood donation sessions;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4)In determining under section 7(3) or (9)(c) of the Local Government Act 1972 which councillors are to retire in accordance with that provision on the fourth day after the ordinary day of election in 2021, councillors who retire in accordance with subsection (2) of this section are to be ignored.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) The conditions or measures which may be specified under paragraph (2)(d) include (b)a restriction on P’s activities;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) A local authority may not give a direction under paragraph (1) in relation to (c)a vessel not falling within paragraph (b), where the direction would be likely to have the effect of preventing a change-over of crew.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But, first, let me update you on the steps we are taking to defeat the coronavirus, and the decisions we have taken today. Step-by-step, our action plan aims to slow the spread of the virus. So that fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, and that is the way we can protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) A local authority may give a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1) only if the authority considers that the following conditions are met (b)that the direction is necessary for the purpose of preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection by coronavirus in the local authority’s area, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The move comes as government prepares to jointly publish an updated action plan on the response of the health care system and the public to COVID-19 together with the governments in the devolved nations. The document, expected to be published later this week, will outline the steps government will take to manage COVID-19 if it there is a sustained UK epidemic.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: We plan for the worst and work for the best, and the NHS is working 24/7 to fight this virus. Calls to NHS 111 have increased by more than a third and we have already put in place 500 extra staff to help with this increase. Every person has a role to play in managing the spread of COVID-19 – whether that’s washing your hands more often for 20 seconds or catching your sneezes.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Paragraph (1) does not prevent a person responsible for carrying on a business or providing a service listed in Schedule 2 (“the closed business”)—
(a)carrying on a business of offering goods for sale or for hire—
(i)in a shop which is separate from the premises used for the closed business; or
(ii)by making deliveries or otherwise providing services in response to orders received—
(aa)through a website, or otherwise by on-line communication,
(bb)by telephone, including orders by text message, or
(cc)by post;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Following last week’s announcement that measures will also consider emergency registration of health professionals who have since retired, the Bill will also look at ensuring that any retired staff who return to work in the NHS will not have their pensions negatively impacted.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4)This subsection applies to—(e)a referendum under or by virtue of Schedule 4B to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (referendums on neighbourhood development plans).;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) The Secretary of State may give a direction to a local authority requiring the authority to give a direction under regulation 4(1), 5(1) or 6(1), if the Secretary of State considers that the conditions in regulation 2(1) would be met in relation to the local authority direction.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) A relevant person may give a prohibition notice to a person if the relevant person reasonably believes that—
(a)the person is contravening a requirement in regulation 4, and
(b)it is necessary and proportionate to give the prohibition notice for the purpose of preventing that person from continuing to contravene the requirement.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Dr Nick Phin, National Infection Service Deputy Director at PHE, said on the reported Wuhan novel coronavirus:  Based on the available evidence, the risk to travellers to Wuhan from this disease is low and we are not advising them to change their plans.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Around 3 million individuals volunteer in a health, community health and social care setting. In the event of a pandemic, we want to be able to maximise the number of volunteers and the amount of time they can commit to supporting the health and social care system – without fear of them losing their jobs. Under these proposed measures, government will ensure the jobs of skilled, experienced or qualified volunteers are protected for up to four weeks to allow them to shore up resilience across the health and social care systems. As part of this, leading business groups will be consulted thoroughly about how best to implement these changes.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A constable may only exercise a power in paragraph (1), (4), or (5) if the constable considers that it is a necessary and proportionate means of ensuring compliance with the requirement in regulation 6(2).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7)Regulations under subsection (1) may make provision by reference to relevant elections or relevant referendums of a description specified in the regulations (for example, by reference to the nature, date or location of the elections or referendums).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(11) A constable or registered public health consultant may, at any time before the expiry of the initial period, authorise the detention of a person for a further period not exceeding 24 hours (beginning immediately at the end of the initial period).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8) Where the Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant orally imposes a requirement on P under this regulation, or orally varies such a requirement, the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, registered public health consultant must provide P (or where P is a child, a person who is a responsible person in relation to P) with a written notification of the requirement that has been imposed or varied.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Where a special restriction or requirement is imposed under this regulation, the person imposing the restriction or requirement must express it to be contingent on the incidence or transmission of Coronavirus constituting a serious and imminent threat to public health as referred to in regulation 3.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But it is now a global pandemic. And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests.
I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Foreign Office continues to work on arrangements to evacuate any remaining British nationals from Hubei Province who wish to leave.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) Paragraph (1) does not affect the exercise of any powers by virtue of regulation 5(1)(c).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Police and crime commissioners
(12)The ordinary election that would otherwise, pursuant to section 50(1) of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 (ordinary election of police and crime commissioners), be held in 2020 is to be held instead in 2021.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming. I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(c)the Department of Health in Northern Ireland to give directions requiring the temporary cessation of childcare provision.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	There is no need to close the school or send other students or staff home.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Paragraph (1)(b) and (c) does not apply where P is a person described in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Local Government Association Chairman Cllr James Jamieson said Giving councils powers to hold meetings remotely is important to maintaining local democracy and allowing critical decisions to be made during this public health crisis. Councils need to respond quickly and make very many key decisions. They can now do so while remaining open, transparent and accessible to the public.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Since January, public health teams and world leading scientists have been working round the clock on the COVID-19 response, and government has been working with partners across the country to provide tailored advice to the public, travellers coming into the country and those most at risk from COVID-19.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) A person removed to or kept in a hospital or other suitable place under this regulation may be detained there for a period not exceeding the permitted period of detention.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) This regulation applies if a constable has reasonable grounds to suspect that— there is a risk that P might infect or contaminate others; and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8)The Scottish Ministers must, at the same time as laying the regulations before the Parliament in accordance with paragraph 26 of that schedule, lay before the Parliament a statement of their reasons for making the regulations.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Government has today outlined further detail on proposed measures expected to be included in an upcoming COVID-19 Emergency Bill, as plans continue to accelerate ahead of an expected move from ‘contain’ to ‘delay’.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(9) A constable may use reasonable force, if necessary, in the exercise of a power under this regulation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope - and save more lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	13.—(1) Where a requirement is imposed on a person to be detained or kept in isolation under regulation 4, 5 or 8, a constable may do any of the following— (b)keep the person in detention or isolation	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But before that I want to stress the following things:
First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(11)Regulations under subsection (9)—
(a)which add to, replace or omit any part of the text of an Act are subject to the affirmative procedure,
(b)otherwise, are subject to the negative procedure.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) P must self-isolate (a)unless sub-paragraph (b) or (c) applies— (iii)where it is not possible for P to self-isolate in accordance with paragraph (i) or (ii), in accommodation facilitated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of P’s self-isolation,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In sum, the very clear advice we have received is that any change to our social distancing measures now would risk a significant increase in the spread of the virus. That would threaten a second peak of the virus, and substantially increase the number of deaths. It would undo the progress made to date, and as a result, would require an even longer period of the more restrictive social distancing measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people. And I also know much, right now, workers and business deserve the financial reassurance we are giving them.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(11) A local authority may only designate a person for the purposes of this regulation in relation to a requirement in regulation 4	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We’re also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) The Secretary of State may by direction restrict access to a specified public outdoor place, or to public outdoor places of a specified description, if the Secretary of State considers that—
(a)giving such a direction—
(i)responds to a serious and imminent threat to public health,
(ii)is necessary to prevent, protect against, control or provide a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection in England of the coronavirus, and
(b)the restrictions in the direction are a proportionate means of achieving that purpose.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good afternoon everyone Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) P must remain in isolation from others (“self-isolate”) in accordance with this regulation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Guided by science and data, we will look to adjust the measures to make them as effective as possible in protecting public health, while allowing some economic and social activity to resume. We will only do it, when the evidence demonstrates that is safe to do it.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: The safety and security of British people will always be our top priority. As such, we now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. Where there are still British Nationals in Hubei Province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this.
	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In relation to a Speaker’s notice received by a petition officer in the period beginning with the day on which this Act is passed and ending with 21 April 2021, section 7 of the 2015 Act (where and from when a recall petition may be signed) has effect as if for subsection (4) there were substituted—
“(4)The petition officer must designate under subsection (1)(b)—
(a)a working day that falls no later than 6 May 2021, or
(b)if it is not reasonably practicable to designate such a day, the first subsequent working day that it is reasonably practicable to designate.”	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)Section 1 of that Act is, accordingly, to be read subject to provision made by an Order under this section.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This measure will not impact the relaxation of planning rules announced earlier this week which will allow pubs and restaurants to operate as hot food takeaways during the coronavirus outbreak, which will help to support people who are staying at home through this period.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)This subsection applies to— (f)an election to fill a vacancy in the office of a mayor for the area of a combined authority under Part 6 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Good afternoon, welcome to the daily coronavirus press conference from Downing Street. I’m joined by Sir Patrick Valance, the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, and Professor Chris Whitty, the government’s Chief Medical Officer. Sir Patrick will provide an update on the latest data on coronavirus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) A direction under paragraph (1) must—
(a)specify or describe the public outdoor place or places to which it relates in sufficient detail to enable the boundaries of the place or places to be determined,
(b)state the date and time on which any prohibition, requirement or restriction imposed by the direction comes into effect, and the date and time on which it will end, and
(c)give details of the right of appeal to a magistrates’ court, and the time within which such an appeal may be brought.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Further measures expected to be included in upcoming COVID-19 Emergency Bill include an expansion of video hearings in courts and new powers to make it easier for volunteers to support the fight against COVID-19	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)Part 3 of Schedule 16 makes provision enabling—
(a)the Department of Education in Northern Ireland to give directions requiring the temporary closure of schools;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) Any person who owns, occupies or is responsible for land or premises in a public outdoor place to which a direction under paragraph (1) relates may—
(a)appeal against the direction to a magistrates’ court by way of complaint for an order and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 applies to the proceedings, and
(b)make representations to the Secretary of State about the direction.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Yesterday I set out the ambition of this government to turn the tide against coronavirus within 3 months. And I want to repeat that determination today. We are going to do it with testing. We are going to do it with new medicines, and with new digital technology that will help us to see the disease as it is transmitted, and thereby, by eliminating it, to stamp it out.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	In the last week alone 430 changes have been made to FCO Travel Advice.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where a child is outside of the place where they are staying in accordance with regulation 6(2) and is accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for the child (“A”) A must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure that the child complies with any direction or instruction given by a constable to the child.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Expert teams continue to actively trace those who have come into contact with a suspected case. Unless an individual has been contacted already or has travelled to an affected area, they should be reassured it is not necessary for them to take any further action.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This will not affect supermarkets or retailers that supply fuel, medicines and other vital goods, which will continue to be open as normal for the public.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	13.—(1) Where a requirement is imposed on a person to be detained or kept in isolation under regulation 4, 5 or 8, a constable may do any of the following—
(a)take the person to a suitable place, specified by the Secretary of State or a public health officer, for the person’s detention or isolation;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are taking all necessary measures to minimise the risk to the public.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)The Secretary of State or the Minister for the Cabinet Office may, by regulations made by statutory instrument, provide—
(a)that the poll for a relevant election or a relevant referendum is to be held on such date, or within such period, as is specified in the regulations;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I want to thank everyone for following the guidance we issued on Monday: to stay at home for 7 days if you think you have the symptoms,	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)The Presiding Officer may (b)where no such date has been fixed, fix a date for the poll that is outwith that period.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs. It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6) In paragraph (3)(a)(ii) “a place at which they intend to self-isolate while in England” means—

(a)where the person has completed a Passenger Locator Form, at an intended place of self-isolation specified in that form,
(b)where the person has completed a form equivalent to a Passenger Locator Form pursuant to an enactment in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, at an intended place of self-isolation specified in that form,
(c)in any other case at a place described in paragraph (4)(a) to (c).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with 7500 former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where a child is outside of the place where they are staying in accordance with regulation 6(2) and is accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for the child (“A”)— (a)a constable may direct A to take the child to the place where the child is staying in accordance with regulation 6(2), and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And of course people have already made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10)Regulations under subsection (9) may—
(a)make different provision for different purposes or areas,
(b)modify any enactment (including this Act).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) A restriction or requirement imposed under paragraph (1)— (a)by the Secretary of State may be varied (orally or in writing) by the Secretary of State;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6)A statutory instrument containing regulations under subsection (2) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1)This section applies where under section 9 of the Scotland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”), an election is to be held to fill a vacant seat of a constituency member (“the election”)	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(14) For the purposes of this regulation “the appropriate authority”, in relation to any land which is Crown land— (a)in the case of land belonging to Her Majesty in right of the Crown and forming part of the Crown Estate, means the Crown Estate Commissioners, and, in relation to any other land belonging to Her Majesty in right of the Crown, means the Government department having the management of that land,
(b)in relation to land belonging to Her Majesty in right of the Duchy of Lancaster, means the Chancellor of the Duchy,
(c)in relation to land belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall, means such person as the Duke of Cornwall, or the possessor for the time being of the Duchy of Cornwall, appoints,
(d)in the case of land belonging to a Government department or held in trust for Her Majesty for the purposes of a Government department, means that department, and
if any question arises as to what authority is the appropriate authority in relation to any land, that question shall be referred to the Treasury, whose decision shall be final	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) A direction under paragraph (1) must— (a)state the date and time on which the prohibition, requirement or restriction comes into effect, and the date and time on which it will end, and
(b)give details of the right of appeal to a magistrates’ court, and the time within which such an appeal may be brought.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3) This paragraph applies where— (a)in the case of a gathering described in paragraph (1)(b)(ii) or (iii)— (iii)the gathering organiser has taken all reasonable measures to limit the risk of transmission of the coronavirus, taking into account the risk assessment carried out under paragraph (ii),	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Further COBRs planned this week, with ministerial COBR meetings upgraded to be held more frequently, if required	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(8)The power to make regulations under subsection (1) is capable of being exercised so as to amend, repeal or revoke any enactment. In this subsection “enactment” has the same meaning as in section 92.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Paragraph (1) does not prevent the use of (b)facilities for training by elite sportspersons, including indoor fitness studios, gyms, sports courts, indoor or outdoor swimming pools and other indoor leisure centres;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3), a reasonable excuse includes where (d)the person needs to enter or remain in a public outdoor place to which the direction relates—
(i)to avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm,
(ii)to continue existing arrangements for access to, and contact between, parents and children where the children do not live in the same household as their parents, or one of their parents,
(iii)to fulfil a legal obligation or to participate in legal proceedings, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)The Presiding Officer may, where a date has been fixed for the poll for the election, fix a later date (which may be outwith the period required under section 10(5) or (6) of the 2006 Act).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Yesterday, the government and rail industry agreed a plan that will see a gradual reduction in train services across the country to reflect lower passenger demand as people change their travel patterns to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, while keeping vital rail services running. The decision to introduce further measures has been taken based on the latest advice from the world-leading health and scientific experts advising the government.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Other government departments will increase their preparations as part of the comprehensive approach to Coronavirus, which has been led so far by DHSC working with NHS England and Public Health England.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5) A person who has provided passenger information in accordance with paragraph (3)(a) or (b) must provide evidence that they have done so if requested by an immigration officer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where P is a child, and has left or is outside of, the place where they are self-isolating and accompanied by an individual who has responsibility for them (b)that individual must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure that P complies with any direction given by an authorised person to P.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I say that to companies, remember our joint objective: to beat this virus. And we will do everything in our power to help.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	While we are currently in the ‘containment’ phase where isolated cases are transferred to hospital and detailed contact tracing is carried out, the next phase could see broader measures introduced to keep the public safe and relieve the pressure on the NHS.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) Where an authorised person has reasonable grounds to believe that a person (“P”) has left, or is outside of, the place where P is self-isolating in contravention of regulation 4, the authorised person may(c)where it is not practicable or appropriate in the circumstances to take the action in sub-paragraph (a) or (b), remove P to accommodation facilitated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of P’s self-isolation.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)In subsections (1) to (4)—
(a)“local government area” has the same meaning as in the Representation of the People Act 1983 (see section 203(1) of that Act);
(b)a reference to the ordinary day of election in a year is to the ordinary day of election of councillors in that year determined under section 37 of that Act (ordinary day of local elections in England).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

(iii)children’s homes, within the meaning of section 1 of the Care Standards Act 2000,
(iv)Residential Family Centres, within the meaning of section 4 of the Care Standards Act 2000,
(v)educational accommodation,
(vi)accommodation intended for use by the army, navy or air force, or

(d)a “charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution” means—
(i)a charity, or
(ii)an institution, other than a charity, established for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes;
(e)“vessel” means any ship, boat, barge, lighter or raft and any other description of craft, whether used in navigation or not, but does not include government vessels.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The unit is one of the teams feeding into the wider Counter Disinformation Cell led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, made up of experts from across government and in the tech sector.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And above all, now we are going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort to slow the spread by reducing unnecessary social contact.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Rapid Response Unit, operating from within the Cabinet Office and No10, is tackling a range of harmful narratives online - from purported ‘experts’ issuing dangerous misinformation to criminal fraudsters running phishing scams.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Secretary of State or a registered public health consultant may require P to be kept in isolation, if the Secretary of State or, as the case may be, registered public health consultant —
(a)has reasonable grounds to believe that P is, or may be, infected or contaminated with Coronavirus; and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	If you are traveling to Wuhan, you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan

nan	(8) A person taken to a hospital or other suitable place under paragraph (7) may be detained there for a period ending no later than the permitted period of detention.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	14.—(1) This regulation applies if a constable has reasonable grounds to suspect that—
(a)a person (“P”) is, or may be, infected or contaminated with Coronavirus;	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10) Any person, other than the responsible local authority and its officers, who owns or is responsible for any part of the restricted area, must take reasonable steps to restrict public access to that part of the restricted area.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	This change in travel advice reflects the pace at which other countries are either closing their borders or implementing restrictive measures in response to the global coronavirus pandemic.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(3)The Presiding Officer must fix a date under subsection (2) for the poll for the election to be held as soon as reasonably practicable.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(c)where P is a person described in paragraph 9(1) of schedule 10 of the Immigration Act 2016(2) (powers of Secretary of State to enable person to meet bail conditions), in accommodation provided or arranged under that paragraph.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The government has temporarily removed the legal requirement for local authorities to hold public meetings in person during the coronavirus pandemic. This will enable councils to make effective and transparent decisions on the delivery of services for residents and ensure that local democracy continues to thrive.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	So early relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period. I want to be clear about this. The advice from SAGE is that relaxing any of the measures currently in place would risk damage to both public health and our economy. Patrick and Chris will be able to go into further detail on all of this shortly.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) A direction under paragraph (1) may, among other things, impose requirements about informing persons who may be planning to attend an event of any prohibitions, requirements or restrictions imposed in relation to the holding of it.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	 A constable may— if P is already at a hospital or other suitable place, keep P at that place or remove P to another hospital or other suitable place for the purposes of the imposition of any restrictions or requirements under regulation 5.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2)The returning officer may—
(a)where a date has been fixed for the poll for the election, fix a later date (which may be outwith the period required under section 37(1) of the 1973 Act), or
(b)where no such date has been fixed, fix a date for the poll that is outwith that period.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The public can be assured that we have a clear plan to contain, delay, research and mitigate, and that we are working methodically through each step to keep the public safe.
I commend this statement to the House.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Public Health England (PHE) is monitoring the situation with international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO). PHE has also issued advice to travellers ahead of Chinese New Year this month.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense. And though we grieve for all those we have lost.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)Regulations under subsection (1) may make provision by reference to relevant elections of a description specified in the regulations (for example, by reference to the nature, date or location of the elections).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(7) A person who has provided passenger information in advance in accordance with paragraph (6) must provide evidence that they have done so if requested by an immigration officer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) A local authority designated officer may give a prohibition notice to a person if the officer reasonably believes that—

(a)the person is contravening a direction under regulation 4(1) or 5(1), and
(b)it is necessary and proportionate to give the prohibition notice for the purpose of preventing that person from continuing to do so.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(6)Subsection (7) applies where—
(a)notice of the date for the poll for the election has been published under Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Scottish Local Government Elections Order 2011 (S.S.I. 2011/399) (“the 2011 Order”), and
(b)under subsection (2)(a), the returning officer fixes a later date for the poll (“the new date”).	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And that’s also why we have directed people to stay at home. To deny coronavirus the opportunity to spread, to protect the NHS and save lives.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(2) Land satisfies this condition if it is a public outdoor place, which is not—

(a)operated by a business, a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution or a public body as a visitor attraction, or
(b)part of premises used for the operation of a business, charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution or a public body.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(5)The power under subsection (2)—
(a)may be exercised more than once,
(b)may not be exercised so as to fix a date for the poll at the election that is within the period mentioned in section 9(4) of the 1998 Act, and
(c)may not be exercised so as to fix a date after 6 May 2021.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(13)The postponement of that ordinary election is to be ignored in determining the years in which subsequent ordinary elections are to be held.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(4) Where a constable considers that a person is, without reasonable excuse, in a public outdoor place in contravention of regulation 7(3), the constable may—
(a)direct that person to leave the place, and	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Today’s developments follow significant government action over the last week, including: The launch of the government’s cross-government ‘war room’ of communications experts and scientists	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Communities Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said: We stand behind businesses and their employees and are offering an unprecedented range of support as we tackle this huge challenge together.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low. But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) Subject to regulation 2, a local authority may give a direction imposing prohibitions, requirements or restrictions in relation to access to—
(a)a specified public outdoor place in its area, or
(b)public outdoor places in its area of a specified description.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Human cases of avian influenza have recently been reported in China, and historically there have been more cases at this time of year. Cases have originated from several provinces and municipalities across mainland China, and there have been a small number of avian influenza cases among Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan residents who have travelled to mainland China.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Based on the latest information and analysis, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that there is evidence of limited human to human transmission of the virus.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(1) Subject to regulation 2, a local authority may give a direction imposing prohibitions, requirements or restrictions in relation to the holding of an event in its area.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities.
And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	We have established a supported isolation facility at Heathrow, to cater for international passengers who are tested, and to maximise infection control and free up NHS resources.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	“the initial period” means the period of 24 hours beginning with—
(a)in a case where the person is removed to a hospital or other suitable place, the time when the person arrives at that place, or	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The Culture Secretary will be contacting social media companies this week to thank them for their good efforts to date, assess the progress made and discuss what other potential measures can be put in place to ensure accurate, honest information consistently reaches users of their platforms.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	The closures will help limit the spread of coronavirus by helping to stop non-essential contact and unnecessary travel, in line with the public guidance announced earlier this week.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	If you have visited Wuhan and develop a fever, difficulty breathing or a cough within 14 days, you should seek medical attention either in China or on your return to the UK.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	But, we’re now at both a delicate and dangerous stage of this pandemic. If we rush to relax the measures in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrifices and all the progress we have made. And that would risk a quick return to another lockdown. With all the threat to life a second peak of the virus would bring, and all the economic damage a second lockdown would carry. So we need to be patient a while longer.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	(10) For the purposes of this regulation—

nan	At every step along this way, we have followed, very carefully and deliberately, the scientific and medical advice that we have received. So that we take the right steps at the right moment in time. At the same time, we are dramatically expanding NHS capacity, in terms of the numbers of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line, so people get the care they need, at the point in time that they need it most.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important. But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
nan	Now, in terms of the decisions that lie ahead, we want to be as up front with the British people as we possibly can. So, let me set out 5 specific things which the government will need to be satisfied of before we will consider it safe to adjust any of the current measures.	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan	nan
